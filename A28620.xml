            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here you have the <hi>Nature, Neceſsity,</hi> and <hi>Difficulty of Faith,</hi> learnedly and practically handled, and eſpecially the <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Royalties of it.</hi> Here alſo is ſhewed the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> And how far a man may go towards Heaven, and yet fall ſhort of it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, As the rude Satyre in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who ſtrove to make a dead man ſtand upright, had ſo much wit as to ſay, <hi>Deeſt aliquid intus,</hi> there wants a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within to inable him to ſtand. So may I truly ſay of him that ſhall read this Book, and not be very well pleaſed with the matter therein contained, <hi>Deeſt aliquid intus,</hi> hee wants a principle of grace within, to cauſe him to cloſe with ſuch wholeſome, ſpiritual, and heavenly truths.</p>
            <p>There are other very profitable Treatiſes of this our Reverend, and godly Brother (prepared by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Preſs) yet behinde, which may happily be brought to light, if God ſhall pleaſe to cauſe this Book to finde acceptance with his people, for whoſe ſpiritual advantage it is intended; And that it may obtain the end for which it is Printed, is the Prayer of</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE occaſion of theſe words, was the hand of God upon the Children of Iſrael, for <hi>Davids</hi> Sin of Numbring the people.</p>
                  <p>You read in Verſe 2. That <hi>David commanded Joab to go and number the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and, at the firſt, <hi>Joab he diſſwaded him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Was it not lawful to number the people?</hi> Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſame in the Wilderneſs, and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea; But <hi>Joab</hi> ſaw the pride of <hi>Davids</hi> heart in it; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his anſwer in Verſe 3.—<hi>And Joab ſaid unto the King, Now the Lord thy God adde unto the people, how many ſoever they be, an hundred fold. But why doth my Lord the King delight in this thing? notwithſtanding the Kings word prevailed againſt Joab;</hi> though indeed to his trouble, and Iſraels coſt.</p>
                  <p>Happy had it been for <hi>David,</hi> and Iſrael too, if the work had not been done. But <hi>Joab</hi> goes, and the number is brought in; There were <hi>Eight hundred thouſand valiant men that drew ſword, and the men of Judah were Five hundred thouſand.</hi>

                  <p>Well, But what was the <hi>Fruit?</hi> what was the <hi>Effect</hi> of this?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You read,—<hi>Davids heart ſmote him,</hi> Verſe 10. that is, <hi>His Conſcience accuſed him.</hi> If <hi>Conſcience</hi> be not a <hi>Bridle,</hi> it will be a <hi>Whip;</hi> if it be not a <hi>Curb,</hi> it will be a <hi>Scourge;</hi> if you will not hear the <hi>Warnings,</hi> you ſhall feel the <hi>Laſhings</hi> of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> if it do not reſtrain from ſin, <hi>Monendo,</hi> by Admonition, it will put us to <hi>Pain</hi> in ſin, <hi>Mordendo,</hi> by Contrition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But there was not all, <hi>God would puniſh him for the ſin;</hi> And you may read the <hi>Sin</hi> in the <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> He had <hi>Gloried</hi> in the <hi>Number,</hi> and therefore God would <hi>Leſſen</hi> the <hi>Number.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet he puts it to his choice, which of the <hi>Three judgements</hi> he propounds (whether <hi>Seven years Famine,</hi> or <hi>Three moneths flight before his Enemies,</hi> or <hi>Three days Peſtilence</hi>) he would take.</p>
                  <p>Every one was <hi>Flagellum Mundans, A ſweeping Scourge.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But here it may be demanded. <hi>Why, when God threatned judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> David <hi>ſhould go and pray for pardon of ſin?</hi> why did he not deſire GOD rather <hi>To forbear his ſtrokes? To avert and turn away his wrath?</hi> Than meerly <hi>To Beg pardon of ſin?</hi> or, if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired this, yet why did he not <hi>Beg the other,</hi> as well as that, and <hi>joyn</hi> them together in the <hi>ſame Petition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To teach us in all the preſſures and evils upon our <hi>Outward man,</hi> to turn our thoughts <hi>Inward, and lament ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe he ſaw <hi>ſin</hi> the <hi>Cauſe of judgement;</hi> and therefore deſires the removing of this, that ſo the other might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe he knew the <hi>judgement</hi> could never be removed in <hi>Mercy,</hi> unleſs the ſin were taken away. <hi>Every Preſervation is but a Reſervation; every Deliverance is in juſtice, not in mercy,</hi> if <hi>ſin</hi> be not taken away.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He was more apprehenſive of the <hi>Diſhonor of</hi> GOD, by his ſin, than of any <hi>judgement</hi> that his ſin had brought upon him. Or,</p>

                     <p>Though <hi>Spiritual ſins</hi> were hid from them, their light was not able to diſcover <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel-ſins;</hi> yet <hi>Moral-ſins</hi> they have diſcovered, and have avoided them, and would hazard themſelves; nay, and ſuffer too, rather than they would commit ſuch ſins. The examples of <hi>Plato, Scipio, Cato,</hi> and many others, will clear this.</p>
                     <p>And all this was diſcovered by the <hi>Glaſs of Nature,</hi> done by <hi>Nature;</hi> but not by <hi>meer Nature fallen,</hi> but by <hi>Nature well-huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, by Nature improved,</hi> by the implantation of <hi>Moral Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> together with <hi>Reſtraining Grace,</hi> and other <hi>common gifts of the Spirit.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of their <hi>Hatred</hi> againſt ſin, the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of their <hi>Care</hi> to avoid ſin, the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> rather than they would <hi>commit ſin,</hi> might be enough to diſcover to us, the <hi>Greatneſs of the Evil of ſin.</hi> But paſs by this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>Glaſs,</hi> wherein you may ſee the <hi>greatneſs of ſin,</hi> is, <hi>The Glaſs of the Law.</hi>

                     <p>How many of the Saints have there been, who have been caſt into a bed of miſerable ſorrow, lain bed-rid under the ſtroke of Juſtice perhaps for many years: And all this for ſin. No age is without a <hi>Thouſand examples</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p>Yea, and the <hi>leaſt ſin,</hi> when <hi>God ſets it on,</hi> will do all this.</p>

                     <p>Nay, it made him, who was <hi>God as well as man, ſanctified</hi> by the Spirit to that work, <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> by the Deity, <hi>To ſweat drops of blood,</hi> and even to <hi>ſtruggle, and ſeem to draw back,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> againſt the <hi>work of his own Mercy,</hi> and to decline the buſineſs of his <hi>own coming</hi> into the world.</p>
                     <p>Ah! none knows but Chriſt, nor is a <hi>finite underſtanding</hi> able to conceive, what Chriſt underwent, when he was to <hi>Bear ſin,</hi> and with that <hi>To wreſtle</hi> with the <hi>infinite wrath and juſtice of the infinite God;</hi> the <hi>Terrors of death,</hi> and the <hi>Powers</hi> of the world to come.

                     <p>Though indeed, this were enough, to tell you, that ſin is the <hi>Greateſt Evil:</hi> Thence would neceſſarily follow, <hi>That it is the Greateſt Mercy in the world, To be rid of ſin;</hi> which will more fully appear, if we conſider the following particulars:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt then, <hi>The pardon of ſin is the deareſt-bought Mercy;</hi> and that is ſomething to ſhew the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You know, the <hi>Greater the ſum is,</hi> that is to be paid for the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of a thing (provided there be no want of wiſdom in the <hi>Buyer,</hi> nor want of <hi>Honeſty</hi> in the <hi>Seller</hi>) the Greater ſtill, and of more worth is the Thing bought or Purchaſed.</p>
                     <p>But now <hi>This Mercy, Pardon of ſin,</hi> was <hi>a Mercy dear-bought:</hi> It coſt <hi>Blood,</hi> Mat. 26.28. and that—<hi>Not the blood of Bulls and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97371:34"/> Goats; for that it was impoſsible it ſhould take away ſins,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. What then was it? Why it was <hi>The Precious blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.—<hi>You were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemiſh and ſpot.</hi> And this, <hi>The Blood of God;</hi> Acts 20.28.— <hi>Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now ſit down, and think what a <hi>Mercy</hi> that muſt needs be, which is the <hi>Price of blood,</hi> and that of the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was no <hi>Want of Wiſdom</hi> in the <hi>Buyer;</hi> he could not be <hi>over-reacht,</hi> he knew the worth of the Commodity: Nor was there <hi>want</hi> of <hi>juſtice</hi> or <hi>goodneſs</hi> in the <hi>Seller.</hi> He was <hi>juſt,</hi> and would not take <hi>one drop of blood more</hi> than the thing was <hi>worth:</hi> And he was <hi>A Father too,</hi> and therefore would not put his <hi>Son to more ſufferings,</hi> and require <hi>more</hi> than the thing was worth.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore in Scripture you read it all attributed to <hi>Grace, Tit.</hi> 3.7—<hi>We are juſtified freely by his Grace</hi>—Rom. 3.24.— <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace,</hi>—Rom. 4.5.—<hi>God juſtifies the ungodly</hi>—There is no <hi>motive</hi> in <hi>us,</hi> All is from God. And you ſhall ſee it plain, one place for two: In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. Verſe 23, 24, 25. —<hi>Thou hast bought me no ſweet cane with money, nor haſt thou made me drink with the fat of thy Sacrifices: But thou haſt made me ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thy iniquities— I, I, am he, that putteth away thy iniquities, for my own names ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> Would a man have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this? this ſheweth freeneſs, when not onely no deſervings, (as it is <hi>v.</hi> 23. and former part of <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Thou haſt not, &amp;c.</hi> but contrary deſervings; <hi>Thou haſt wearied mee with thine iniquities.</hi> Oh infinite, oh freeſt mercy. God is mercifull only becauſe hee will bee mercifull.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It is <hi>an Intituling Mercy:</hi> A <hi>Mercy</hi> that <hi>Intitles</hi> you to more <hi>Good</hi> than I am able to expreſs, or you able to conceive. It is a <hi>Mercy,</hi> that doth intereſt you in <hi>all other Mercies.</hi> It <hi>Intitles</hi> you to <hi>all the Good on Earth,</hi> to <hi>All the glory of Heaven.</hi> Nay, it is a <hi>Mercy-making-Mercy. A mercy,</hi> that makes all other things <hi>Mercy</hi> to you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Good things are mercies.</hi> Your Riches, your Greatneſs, your Poſſeſſions, your Husbands, your Wives, Children, &amp;c. all theſe things are no <hi>Bleſsings,</hi> till they be joyned with a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and that makes them all bleſſings. Nay, not onely <hi>Good things:</hi> But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Evil things are Mercies</hi> to you. Pardon of ſin makes Poverty, Afflictions, Sickneſs, Death it ſelf a <hi>Mercy:</hi> Like the <hi>Unicorns horn,</hi> it takes away the <hi>venome</hi> and <hi>poyſon</hi> of every <hi>Water:</hi> Like the <hi>Philoſophers-ſtone,</hi> it turns <hi>All into Gold.</hi> So ſaith the Apoſtle— <hi>All things work together for good unto them that love God.

                     </p>
                     <p>You are never able to make it good, that God doth beſtow any thing in <hi>mercy, till ſin be forgiven. Guilt of ſin</hi> upon you doth turn the <hi>nature of things,</hi> and makes thoſe things which are <hi>good</hi> in themſelves, <hi>evil</hi> to you.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is an <hi>irrevocable-mercy</hi>—God may give in other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and call for them again. Indeed other things are rather <hi>lent,</hi> than <hi>given: Lent Husband, Lent Wife,</hi> &amp;c. Hence they are ſaid to be but <hi>Talents</hi> in our hands, and we <hi>Stewards</hi> of them
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97371:35"/> for a time. God may call for them when he pleaſeth; or we may <hi>forfeit</hi> them, and <hi>loſe them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How often do we <hi>forfeit</hi> and <hi>loſe good things,</hi> becauſe of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy walking in the enjoyment thereof? <hi>Hoſ,</hi> 2.8, 9—<hi>I will take away my corn in the time thereof; my wine, and my flax in their ſeaſon. [Mine]</hi> It was Gods. And, would you know the reaſon? ſee in the former verſe, Becauſe they did not acknowledge him as the giver of them, but beſtowed them on <hi>Baal,</hi> as though he had given them.</p>
                     <p>But now this <hi>Mercy is an irrevocable Mercy: A mercy</hi> that God <hi>never recals; A Mercy, God never repents of—The gifts and graces of God are without repentance</hi>—And it is a <hi>Mercy never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may <hi>forfeit the ſenſe of a pardon,</hi> we may <hi>forfeit the comfort of a pardon;</hi> nay, we may <hi>forfeit the knowledge of a pardon.</hi> I ſay, you may ſin away the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> the <hi>comfort,</hi> the <hi>knowledge of a pardon:</hi> as it was with <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we ſhall never <hi>forfeit a pardon—Quod Scripſi, Scripſi.</hi> If all this foreſeen could not hinder God from <hi>giving out a pardon;</hi> neither can it make <hi>God repent of a pardon,</hi> when he <hi>hath given it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Stability of the Mercy</hi> is that, which addes a great deal of <hi>worth</hi> to the <hi>Mercy.</hi> As things that are <hi>Evil;</hi> ſo much more things that are <hi>good,</hi> are <hi>heightned</hi> from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>continuance of them,</hi> the <hi>Stability and Laſtingneſs</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>Now this is a <hi>Stable Mercy.</hi> Take but <hi>one Place,</hi> Iſa. 54.8, 9, 10—<hi>For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: For, as I have ſworn that the waters of Noah ſhould no more go over the earth: So have I ſworn, that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</hi> —Yet further—<hi>For the mountains ſhall depart, and the hills ſhall be removed: but my kindeneſs ſhall never depart from thee, nor ſhall the Covenant of my peace be removed.</hi>

                     <p>Didſt thou know the <hi>Tenor</hi> of the Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> the <hi>Strictneſs</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Severity</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> it ſelf againſt ſin; thou wouldſt ſee, There were an <hi>impoſsibility of having one ſin forgiven, as long as one ſin is unforſaken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification: Gods forgiving,</hi> and <hi>our forgoing,</hi> are equally as <hi>large one as the other.</hi> As <hi>God juſtifies</hi> from the <hi>guilt of all ſin;</hi> ſo he <hi>ſanctifies</hi> from the <hi>Corruption of all Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grace in God forgives all Sin.</hi> And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grace in us makes us forgo all Sin:</hi> where ſin is <hi>forgiven,</hi> there ſin is <hi>forſaken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A Third ſort,</hi> are they, <hi>Who ſeek a pardon of Sin, without ſenſe of Sin;</hi> who ſeek <hi>forgiveneſs of Sin,</hi> without <hi>remorſe</hi> for ſin: Men, who are never troubled with any ſenſe, with any compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart for ſin.</p>
                     <p>Would you not take it for a dallying with you; if one had greatly offended you, and ſhould come to deſire you your <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,</hi> without <hi>any ſenſe</hi> or <hi>remorſe</hi> of it? What do you think God will do?</p>
                     <p>This is certain—<hi>Without blood there is no Remiſsion of Sin,</hi> as the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97371:37"/> Apoſtle ſpeaks—Chriſt was <hi>wounded,</hi> and thou muſt be <hi>wounded</hi> too, before thou haſt a <hi>pardon</hi>—Chriſt did <hi>bleed,</hi> and <hi>conſcience</hi> muſt <hi>bleed,</hi> before ever he <hi>give a pardon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was a ſpeech of <hi>Bradford—He never left a duty, till, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Will a man in good earneſt beg a pardon, who was never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached for Treaſon, or ſo much as throughly ſenſible, that he is guilty of it?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>A Fourth ſort,</hi> are ſuch, as <hi>cry for Forgiveneſs, but yet never look after their Prayers.</hi> Would you not think it a <hi>ſlighting,</hi> if a man, who had offended you, ſhould come and beg a pardon; and as ſoon as he had ſaid a few words to you, ſhould turn his back, and go away, and never expect, nor wait for an anſwer from you?</p>
                     <p>Why thus do you deal with God: You put up prayers, but look not after them. He, who begs in earneſt, Oh! he will <hi>Diligently obſerve,</hi> what <hi>Anſwer,</hi> what <hi>Return God makes:</hi> He will <hi>obſerve</hi> what word of <hi>Comfort</hi> God lets fall, what intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions God will afford to his ſpirit, and will be exceeding chary of them. As you ſee <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.31, 32, 33. After they had put up their requeſts, the Text ſaith— <hi>The men did diligently obſerve, whether any thing would come from Ahab; and did hastily catch at it.</hi> So ſhould we do: Come with ſackcloath, put up our prayers with <hi>remorſe;</hi> and, when that is done, when we have <hi>prayed our prayers,</hi> let us <hi>wait our prayers,</hi> to ſee what <hi>intimations</hi> we ſhall receive from heaven. Thus <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 85.8.—<hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak; for he will ſpeak Peace to his people, and to his Saints, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 5.3— <hi>In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and I will look up.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>A Fift ſort,</hi> who <hi>dally with God,</hi> are they, <hi>who follow not their prayers with endeavors to get aſſurance, that their Sins are pardoned.</hi> Who ſearch not into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> acquaint not themſelves with the <hi>Promiſes of Grace;</hi> ſearch not into the <hi>Word of Grace,</hi> frequent not the <hi>Means of Grace:</hi> Theſe men dally, who frequent not the <hi>Word, Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Means</hi> for the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of <hi>Pardon.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Text, which after wee have been ſome while in Heaven, wee ſhall bee able to underſtand.</p>
                  <p>Certainly none can ſpeak fully to this Text, but they who have the full injoyments of this Love.</p>
                  <p>But things that are not poſſible to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, are not totally to bee omitted; and therefore wee will lanch into the main Ocean. And when wee are not able to apprehend this love, let us caſt our ſelves in, and let it comprehend us.</p>
                  <p>Some things in the General wee premiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Author,</hi> or Penman; it was <hi>Solomon</hi> inſpired by the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Title</hi> of the Book; it is called <hi>The Song of Songs;</hi> or, a moſt excellent Song. So it is called for the excellency; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity. The doubling of the words declare the excellency. As when the Scripture ſpeaks of baſe things; by doubling the words they are more debaſed; as it was ſaid of <hi>Cham,</hi> Gen. 9.25. <hi>A ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of ſervants ſhall hee bee:</hi> that is, <hi>a vile ſlave.</hi> So when it ſpeaks
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97371:39"/> of good things by doubling the words, it declares the excellency of the thing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. <hi>The Lord your God, is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Thus much for the Title.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As concerning the <hi>Matter;</hi> there is difference among Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> a Jewiſh Rabbin thinks it to bee an Hiſtory of the Church of God from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another thinks it to bee an Hyſtory of the Church from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the freedome of the Church by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, who lived in the beginning of the fourth Century.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another makes it contain a prophetical Hyſtory of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church from <hi>David</hi> to the end of the World. And divides the book into theſe two parts. The Church
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Under the Law.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Under the Goſpel.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Church under the Law, from <hi>David</hi> to the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is continued from the beginning of the Book, to the ſixth verſe of the fourth Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it was from <hi>David</hi> to the Captivity; which ſaith hee, is contained in the firſt Chapter, and the two firſt verſes of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it was in the Captivity, from the ſecond verſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, to the fifteenth verſe of the ſecond Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As it was after the Captivity, till the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the abrogation of the Church under the Law; which continues from the fifteenth verſe of the ſecond Chapter, to the ſixth verſe of the fourth Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And from that, to the end of the Book is contained an Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church Evangelical, till <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſecond comming. Of this mind is <hi>Brightman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to leave this, wee think (and with us goes the ſtream of Orthodox Interpreters) that the ſubject matter of this Book is a Parabolical Hyſtory of the mutual loves betwixt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Church, ſet down under the perſons of the Bridegroom, and his Bride. And thus much of the Book in general. Wee will now draw neerer to our Text.</p>
                  <p>In the former Chapter we read, how the Church, the Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth declare her exceeding love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and her high ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiations of him, with her earneſt deſire to injoy him, whom her ſoul ſaw ſo precious, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might diſcover to her, how kindly hee took her affection.</p>
                  <p>In this Chapter hee doth again enter into a ſingular commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the excellency of the Church, declaring alſo his unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned love to her.</p>
                  <p>The whole Chapter contains theſe parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A ſingular commendation of the Church by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which is ſet down allegorically from the firſt verſe to the fifth, and from the tenth to the fourteenth verſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:97371:39"/>2. A gracious profeſſion of <hi>Chriſts</hi> love to his Church, from the fifth verſe to the tenth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Churches reply, with <hi>Chriſts</hi> anſwer again to her, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>In the Churches reply; 1. A commendation of her head and Husband, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.2. An earneſt deſire, of further communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Spirit, and communion with himſelf, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Chriſts</hi> anſwer there is contained a Promiſe of his gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of ſuch fruits as the Church ſhall yeeld him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>This verſe which I have read to you is a branch of the ſecond part. <hi>(ſcil.) The gracious profeſſion of Chriſt his love to his Church;</hi> of which, if I read no more than this verſe, wee ſee enough ſet down to aſtoniſh and amaze us all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my Heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe. Quid mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſi regnum caelorum vim patitur, &amp;c!</hi> What wonder if the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffer violence, when the King of Heaven himſelf ſuffers violence!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth here ſpeak in the manner of a Lover, whoſe heart is exceedingly raviſhed, and taken with the beauties, vertues, and graces of his Spouſe.</p>
                  <p>Give mee leave to explain the words, and wee come to Doctrin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed.]</hi> What is meant by that? The expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is great, that the God of Heaven ſhould bee ſo taken, even to raviſhment with his Church and people.

                  <p>Why all this and more the Scripture ſaith, and all this is yet ſhort of this expreſſion, <hi>his Heart is taken with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, the next particular will give us further inſight into.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt is exceedingly taken,</hi> I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to you by diverſe arguments.</p>
                  <p>That which the thoughts are taken up withall, that the heart muſt needs bee taken withall.</p>
                  <p>This is plain, you know a man will buſie his thoughts about that which hee cares for: wouldeſt thou know what thou loveſt;<note place="margin">Vis noſſe quod ames, attende quod cogites. Bern.</note> ſee what thy thoughts are upon. As if hee had ſaid, there can bee no better character to diſcover what your hearts are taken withall, than to examine what your thoughts are moſt taken up withall; for what the thoughts are taken up withall, the heart is taken withall. Now the thoughts of Chriſt are exceedingly taken up with his Church and people. Wee are ever upon his thoughts.</p>
                  <p>There hath not been a moment from all eternity wherein wee have been out of the thoughts of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Before the World was; wee were on his thoughts, hee thought on us to everlaſting life, loved us with everlaſting love.</p>
                  <p>After wee had loſt our ſelves, wee were then on his thoughts, when hee interpoſed himſelf between God and us, to ſtay his wrath from us.</p>
                  <p>Before wee came into the World wee were on his thoughts, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all the Scripture, in which are ſuch expreſſions of his heart to us. After hee came into the World, you ſee wee were the whole of his thoughts, wee lay ever upon his heart; you ſee by his doings, ſufferings, prayer for us. Read the 14, 15, 16, 17. of <hi>John.</hi> See how his thoughts were taken up with us, when hee was to leave us, what love hee ſhewed, what care hee expreſſed to us, what earneſt prayers hee put up to God for us; read <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9. to the end of the chapter. Yea and what proviſion hee made for us, hee would not leave us comfortleſs, but ſend his Spirit to comfort us, to guide us.</p>
                  <p>And now hee is in Heaven, are not his thoughts on us? did hee not tell us hee went to prepare a place for us, hee went to do our work, to intercede for us, to plead for us.</p>
                  <p>The Church of Chriſt is never a moment off from the thoughts of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15, 16. And therefore <hi>his Heart is exceedingly taken with his Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which a man doth affectionately and indearedly love, that the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97371:41"/> heart is much taken withall, bee it Husband, bee it Wife, Child, the World, whatever.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt doth exceedingly love his Church, wee are ſaid to bee the dearly beloved of his ſoul, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.7. and read here, hee loves us beyond all expreſſions, ſo <hi>God loved the World,</hi> Joh. 3.16. ſo Chriſt hee loves us beyond all conceptions, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. it is a love which paſſeth knowledge.</p>
                  <p>In the former verſe the Apoſtle went about to meaſure this love, height, depth, breadth, length.</p>
                  <p>But hee found his line too ſhort, his meaſure would not reach, therefore hee concludes it a love beyond all knowledge.</p>
                  <p>A man may expreſs much love, but hee may conceive of more than hee can expreſs. Why this love of Chriſt is above all wee can conceive, above knowledge. It is an infinite love. It is, I ſay, an infinite love, which is more than if I ſhould lay all the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in the Creature together, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A greater love than all. Witneſs what is done, ſuffered, and yet love above all. And therefore <hi>Chriſts Heart is exceedingly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with his Church and People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which a man doth glad his heart with, and which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces over, hee muſt needs bee taken with.</p>
                  <p>A man will not rejoyce over the injoyment of that hee loves not. The rich Fool rejoyced over his full Barns, but it was becauſe his heart was taken with his poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>Joy is a fruit of the hearts being taken with any thing; you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in your riches, Husbands, &amp;c. in the poſſeſſion of what ever your heart loves. Now the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly rejoyce over his Church and People; they are his by donation, God gave them to him; they are his by purchaſe, hee laid down his life for them; if wee lay down our life to compaſs a thing ſure wee rejoyce in it.</p>
                  <p>Wee are his Riches, wee his Treaſure, his <hi>Ammies, Ruhama's,</hi> and <hi>Hephzibah's,</hi> his precious ones, his People, his Spouſe; and therefore hee muſt needs rejoyce over us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.4, 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt bee called</hi> Heph-zibah, <hi>for the Lord delighteth in thee:</hi> yea as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The Lord will rejoyce over thee with Joy, hee will reſt in his love, hee will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing Chriſt doth rejoyce. <hi>Ergo is the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt exceedingly taken, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which a man doth delight to converſe withall, that his heart is taken withall.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt doth delight exceedingly to converſe with his Saints, hee loves to ſpeak to them, and hee loves to hear them ſpeak to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Oh my Dove, let mee ſee thy countenance, let mee hear thy voice, for thy countenance is comely, and thy voice is ſweet.</hi> When the Diſciples are talking of him, Chriſt joyns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97371:41"/> to them. <hi>Ergo is the Heart of Chriſt much taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the two were going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> Luk. 24.15. Chriſt comes and joynes with them, delights in their talk, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. when Gods people were gathered together, <hi>the Lord hearkened and heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That which a man thinks nothing to dear for, nothing too much to give for, to do for, or ſuffer for, that the heart muſt needs bee taken withall.</p>
                  <p>But thus it was with Chriſt to his Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee ſuffered in his Body, thoſe ſpittings, buffetings, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, &amp;c. that was dear to him, which hee gave his heart bloud for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hee ſuffered in his ſoul even the wrath of God for her.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hee emptied himſelf of his own glory, took upon him the form of a ſervant, with all our infirmities; penal, not culpable, as it is ſaid of <hi>Jacob,</hi> hee counted all his labours but little for <hi>Rachel,</hi> becauſe hee loved her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.20.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That which a mans ſoul is ſatisfied and contented withall in the injoyment of it, that a mans heart is taken withall.</p>
                  <p>If a mans heart were not taken with the love of a thing, hee would never think himſelf happy, never bee contented and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the injoyment of it. Whereas on the contrary, where the ſoul is filled with ſatisfaction in the injoyment of it (what ever it bee) the heart is taken with it.</p>
                  <p>Now you ſhall ſee that the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt is fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and contented with the injoyment of his Church, though it have coſt him ſo much pains, ſo much ſweat and bloud, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it is reward enough to him. It is the reward which God promiſed him for his work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of mee, and I will give thee the</hi> Heathen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here, merit of mee, lay down thy life, and I will then give thee a Church, a People. And that which doth ſatisfie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53 11. <hi>Hee ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;</hi> hee ſhall ſee the fruit of his ſufferings in the ſaving of ſouls, and ſhall bee ſatisfied with it. It ſhall bee reward enough to him for all pains that ſouls are ſaved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.11. his reward is with him, and his work before him, hee is the ſalvation of his people.</p>
                  <p>And this is that which ſome think is meant by the joy ſet before him, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Who for the joy that was ſet before him, indured the Croſs, deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Joy (ſaith an holy and learned Interpreter) is nothing elſe but the fruit of his ſufferings, the redemption and ſalvation of his Church and People, according to that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. <hi>Therefore will the Lord divide him a portion with the great, and hee ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, becauſe hee hath poured out his ſoul unto death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is an Interpretation may bee backed.</p>
                  <p>Well then, ſeeing whatever the heart of man reſts ſatisfied in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97371:42"/> injoyment of, the heart is taken withal.</p>
                  <p>And that Chriſt doth reſt ſatisfied in the injoyment of his Church and People, though it coſt ſo much to obtain it. <hi>Ergo</hi> needs muſt it follow that <hi>the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt is exceedingly taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which a man is exceeding chary of, dear of, his heart muſt needs bee taken with, thoſe things which take our hearts, wee are exceeding dear and chary of them.</p>
                  <p>If it bee the World, Husband, Wife, Child, a man is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding chary of them. <hi>Deal gently with the young man</hi> Abſolom, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.5. his heart was taken with him, and hee was chary of him.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt is exceeding chary over his Church: Oh! it is dear to him, therefore hee gives charge to the World, touch not one of theſe, you touch the apple of mine eye, offend not one of theſe little ones, they are dear to mee, hee is chary over them.</p>
                  <p>Yea hee doth not only charge, but menace too, and threatens men if they ſhall hurt any of his little ones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It had been better for you, that a Milſtone were tyed about your necks, and caſt into the middle of the Sea, than to offend any of theſe little ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is exceeding chary over his Church and People, they are dear to him.</p>
                  <p>Take a taſte of it, <hi>Job.</hi> 18.8. when hee himſelf was in that Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and when hee ſuffered himſelf to bee hailed before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and to dye, yet you ſee how chary hee was over his Diſciples; why ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I am hee you ſeek for, if therefore you ſeek mee, let theſe go their way:</hi> As if hee had ſaid, I am hee whom you ſeek, and againſt whom your malice goes forth, do what you will with mee, but ſpare theſe, let theſe go (what have theſe done?) with <hi>Jonah,</hi> caſt mee into the Sea, that the ſtorm may ceaſe, nail mee on the Croſs, fling mee into the grave, do with mee what you will, that theſe may eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Oh! Chriſt muſt needs bee chary of them, when hee would put his back between his Church and the ſtripes, interpoſe his ſoul between the wrath of God and them.</p>
                  <p>Drink of that bitter cup that they might not taſte of it, bee wounded that they might bee healed, bear the curſe, that they might carry away the bleſſing, as there was no ſorrow to his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſo no love to his love, all loves are loſt, nay, ſeem hatred in compariſon of his.</p>
                  <p>Another place, <hi>John</hi> 7.9. to the 16. ſee there when he was to go from them, how chary hee was over them, he commends them to his Father, and deſines him to keep them whom hee had given him. As if hee had ſaid, Father they are mine, and I love them dearly, I have done much for them, but I will do more, therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, therefore keep them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am no more in the World, but theſe are in the World, holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through thine own name keep thoſe whom thou haſt given mee;</hi> thus
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97371:42"/> you ſee how chary Chriſt was over them. And therefore his <hi>heart is exceedingly taken with his Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee will keep them from trouble, hee will buy out their trouble with the troubles of the whole World, and their lives with the lives of thouſands; you have a place for this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.3, 4. <hi>I gave</hi> Egypt <hi>for thy ranſome, I gave</hi> Ethiopia <hi>and</hi> Seba <hi>for thee:</hi> God will give whole Kingdomes for his Church to preſerve them from trouble. <hi>I have loved thee, therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, I ſtand not at it to give the heads of a thouſand men, the lives of ten thouſands to ſave thy life, to preſerve thee. The Ramme to ſave <hi>Iſaac,</hi> hee is chary of them; if not to keep them from trouble, yet to ſupport them in trouble.</p>
                  <p>Hee is chary of them, hee will deliver them out of trouble, hee will not ſuffer the rod of the wicked to reſt.</p>
                  <p>Though for a time, yet, &amp;c. <hi>many are the troubles of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> but hee knows how to deliver his, and reſerve the wicked. If Chriſt do not deliver thee from trouble, yet hee will deliver thee in trouble; and at laſt hee will deliver thee out, who knows how to deliver his; when thou not, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That which a man thinks all too little, nothing too much, too dear to beſtow upon, that the heart of a man is exceedingly taken withall.</p>
                  <p>Where all the expreſſions that a man can lay out, do ſtill fall ſhort of his affections to it, it is a ſign the heart is much taken with ſuch a thing.</p>
                  <p>When a man thinks not riches, nor labour, nor his bloud, his life too dear; this ſhews the heart is much taken with it.</p>
                  <p>Now the Church is ſo dear to Chriſt, that hee thinks nothing too dear, nothing too much for it.</p>
                  <p>It was not his bloud within his veins, nor his life within his breaſt, which hee counted too dear for her.</p>
                  <p>Hee can beſeem to beſtow any thing on her.</p>
                  <p>Hee will beſtow temporals on her,<note place="margin">Dabit ſua quod non detinuit ſe.</note> at leaſt ſo much as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for her. All things neceſſary for life, godlineſs, if hee give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how much more all things? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. will hee give the greater, and deny the leſs? no. That love which gave the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will not deny thee the leſs; if it were good for thee; ſo much hee hath ingaged himſelf by Covenant to give thee as to bear thy charge to Heaven, and then there is no want.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lions ſhall hunger and ſuffer want, &amp;c.</hi> Hee beſtows Grace on thee; and Faith is more precious than Gold: Hee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow out words on thee, and yet his heart never taken with thee. <hi>Dives</hi> had more wealth; uttered more eloquence, <hi>Saul</hi> more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Agrippa</hi> more glorious apparel, than thoſe his heart is taken withall.</p>
                  <p>Hee may give Wealth to a <hi>Dives,</hi> Command to a <hi>Saul,</hi> Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to a <hi>Herod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:97371:43"/>
                  <p>But hee never beſtows Grace on any, but it is an evidence his heart is taken with a man.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Abraham</hi> gave portions to the ſons of the <hi>Concubines,</hi> but <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac</hi> had the inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Hee will beſtow his Spirit on thee, to inlighten, renew, &amp;c. Hee will beſtow himſelf on thee, the collectioner of all other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; God cannot extend his love further in giving, nor wee ours in deſiring. And that which a man beſtows himſelf upon muſt needs bee precious in his eyes. Chriſt doth beſtow himſelf on thee.</p>
                  <p>Who is the <hi>ſummum genus</hi> of gifts, the gift of gifts. The gift which doth intitle us to all other gifts, all is yours, if you bee Chriſts.</p>
                  <p>The gift which ſweetens and ſanctifies all other: Like the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns horn takes away the venome and poiſon of all other. There is a curſe with all other gifts if Chriſt bee not given.</p>
                  <p>A curſe to your Gold, your Silver, your Proſperity, your Meat, Drink, Health, and Strength.</p>
                  <p>But where Chriſt is given, hee takes off the curſe, ſanctifies all; hee doth not only turn comforts into bleſſings, but croſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>A bleſſing in ſickneſs, in poverty, in death, &amp;c. Chriſt beſtows himſelf upon his Church, hee doth paſs over himſelf, and all his by deed of gift, hee and all his is yours: As you and all yours are his; your ſins, and ſorrows all his.</p>
                  <p>And all his are yours; his merits, his Spirit. As Chriſt ſaid to the Father, ſo may yee to Chriſt; all thine is mine; his merit, cloathing, his bloud drink, fleſh meat. Hee is meat, drink, cloaths. Chriſt doth not ſtay here, but hee beſtows Heaven upon his Church. It is the Mannor houſe which hee hath reſerved for his Spouſe. <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given mee, may bee where I am, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 17.24.</p>
                  <p>They are married together, and co-habitation is a marriage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> had two houſes for his Spouſes.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſeeing Chriſt thinks nothing too dear to beſtow upon his Church: hence muſt needs follow; <hi>That the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt is exceedingly taken with his Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe which Chriſt hath made all things for, to ſerve for the good of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe whom hee hath prepared Glory for, Heaven for.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe which hee hath ſhed his bloud for, muſt needs bee dear to him, his Heart much taken with them.</p>
                  <p>If a King ſhould build a ſtately houſe, for one with whom hee would ſolace himſelf all his life; and ſhould at laſt give life too, you would think ſure hee loved him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God made all for thee, the Sun, Moon, Stars, Creatures;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97371:43"/> all this frame of the World; ſure you are dear to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God prepared Heaven for thee, a place of Glory, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; where thou ſhouldeſt for ever injoy him, and ſolace thy ſelf with his love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt ſhed his bloud for thee, which was more dear to him than ten thouſand Worlds. What is all the World, and ten thouſand Worlds in compariſon of one drop of his bloud? and therefore they whom hee ſhed his bloud for, muſt needs bee more dear to him than all the World; his Heart is taken with them.</p>
                  <p>Thus far now wee have gone in the breaking up the <hi>rich Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of Chriſts Love,</hi> the ſent whereof hath cheared and revived us.

                  </p>
                  <p>Wee will but give you theſe three grounds, all which are taken not from us, but from himſelf, his own mercy. In brief, Either

So here; wee are His; Hee hath propriety in us, and therefore loves us, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.10.<note place="margin">Cant. 7.10.</note> The Spouſe makes the ſame argument. <hi>I am my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds, and hee is mine: therefore his deſire is towards mee,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his heart is taken with mee; therefore his ſoul loves mee. And wee are his, in the deareſt and ſweeteſt relations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee are his People, his ſubjects. <hi>Chriſt is the King of Saints,</hi> whoſe throne is in our hearts, and will brook no Rival: whoſe Scepter is his Word, and whoſe Word is our Law. Nay, leaſt this bee too little.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee are his <hi>Friends. Henceforth I call you not Servants, but Friends.</hi> Wee are his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Favourites.</hi> Nay,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wee are his <hi>Children,</hi> begotten again, and born again to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Being born again, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wee are his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> ſuch as hee hath married to himſelf in faithfulneſs and truth, and ſuch as hee delights in.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Wee are his <hi>Members.</hi> The Church is his <hi>Body,</hi> his <hi>fulneſs,</hi> and <hi>every one Members in particular,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Wee are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> his <hi>Treaſure,</hi> Mal. 3.7. <hi>In the day that I make up my Jewels, they ſhall bee mine.</hi> And therefore his heart muſt needs bee taken with us. Chriſt hath the ſame argument. <hi>Where the Treaſure is; there will the heart bee alſo.</hi> The <hi>Heart,</hi> and a mans <hi>Treaſure</hi> lye together. Now wee are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> his <hi>Treaſure,</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97371:44"/> muſt <hi>dearly earn it too.</hi> And therefore <hi>the Heart of Chriſt is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly taken with his Church and People.</hi> So you ſee this is the firſt ground, why, <hi>becauſe wee are his, and his in the deareſt, neareſt, choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt of Relations.</hi>

Here was only his free mercy. There was no ground to make him chuſe us, before hee loved us: but there is ſome ground to cauſe him to love us, now hee hath choſen us. Wee are his, and his by <hi>free choice,</hi> choſen and ſingled out of a world of men. And therefore will hee love us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee are his <hi>By Purchaſe.</hi> Hee hath bought us, and that at a dear rate, with the <hi>price of his own blood,</hi> Gal. 4.5. <hi>Chriſt was made under the Law, that hee might buy out thoſe,</hi> who were under the Law. Hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>You are bought with a price.</hi> And what was the price? It could not bee too little for the meanneſs of the commodity, not worth owning when hee had it. But it coſt him his <hi>deareſt Hearts-blood;</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Wee were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but with the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb, without blemiſh, without ſpot.</hi> So then wee are his by Purchaſe; wee are the fruits of all his pains; of all his doings and ſufferings; wee are the commings in which Chriſt had for his Bloud; wee are his Purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>God did covenant and bargain with Chriſt, that if hee would
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97371:44"/> lay down his life and bloud for a people, hee ſhould have them: which you ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of mee, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance,</hi> that is, ſaith one, merit of mee, lay down thy life and bloud, and thou ſhalt have a people: as you ſee in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, 12. <hi>Hee ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That if hee would dye, wee ſhould live: if hee would bear the curſe, wee ſhould have the bleſſing. If hee would bear that wrath our ſins deſerved, and interpoſe himſelf between the Juſtice of God and us, the quarrel ſhould bee taken up; God would bee at peace. If hee would purchaſe us, hee ſhould injoy us. And Chriſt hee undertook this. Hee loved us; and ſeeing hee could not have us, except hee did buy us; and could not buy us, except hee gave his bloud for us, and as it were ſell himſelf to the juſtice of God, that hee might buy us out: <hi>Hee was content to do it.</hi> Hee redeemed us, not with ſilver or gold, &amp;c. And now being purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him, his by <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> and ſo <hi>dear a Purchaſe;</hi> his heart muſt needs bee taken with us. Indeed hee bought us, becauſe hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us: and now hee loves us, becauſe hee hath bought us. If wee did lay down our bloud, our life for the purchaſe of a thing, and could after live to injoy it, how exceedingly would our hearts delight in it! Chriſt hath given his bloud, and laid down his life for the purchaſe of his Church and People; and hee lives to injoy his purchaſe; and therefore the Heart of Chriſt muſt needs bee taken with it.</p>
                  <p>Shall I tell you? You are all the delight which Chriſt hath in the World: Hee delights to ſee you, hee delights to bee with you; hee delights to converſe with you; and all the delights of Chriſt are taken up with you; hee hath nothing worth beholding but you, in the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wee are his <hi>By Donation.</hi> God hath given us to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given mee, ſhall come unto mee,</hi> Joh. 17.9, 11, 12. <hi>I pray not for the World, but for them whom thou haſt given mee. — Holy Father, keep through thy own name thoſe whom thou haſt given mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee were ſo <hi>bought,</hi> as yet wee were <hi>given:</hi> elſe where is <hi>Gods Mercy?</hi> and ſo <hi>given,</hi> as yet wee were <hi>bought:</hi> elſe where is his <hi>Justice?</hi> Gods armes are equal; in the length of the one, you have the meaſure of the other: and therefore hee did ſo expreſs his <hi>Mercy</hi> to man, as withall hee did preſerve his <hi>Justice.</hi> They were ſo given, as yet bought; and ſo bought as yet given.</p>
                  <p>And being his by <hi>Donation,</hi> God having made them over to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Deed of Gift,</hi> being the full deſire of Chriſt, hence the Heart of Chriſt is taken with them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wee are his <hi>By Covenant,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. <hi>Then I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> Chriſt became ours, wee his: Hee is our King, and wee his People hee is our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and wee his Spouſe: hee hath given himſelf to us, and wee
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97371:45"/> have re-given our ſelves to him: wee his delight, hee ours. And being his in Covenant, in mutual ſtipulation, and bargain, the Heart of Chriſt is taken with us.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt doth communicate to his Church his <hi>Imputed Beauty,</hi> then 2. His <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> wherewith hee cloaths our ſouls. Hence Hee is called <hi>Jehovah-our-Righteouſneſs.</hi> And is ſaid to bee made <hi>Wiſdome, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Redemption.</hi> And wee to <hi>put on Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Righteouſneſſe Chriſt doth communicate to us by <hi>Imputation</hi> making it ours, as if we in our own perſons had wrought it. And it is as truly ours to ſave us, to juſtifie us, as it is his to glorifie him. And God looking upon us through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> looking upon us in himſelf, as cloathed with his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hee beholds us beautifull. <hi>Hee ſees no iniquity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor tranſgreſſion in</hi> Iſrael. Not but that there was iniquity in <hi>Jacob;</hi> but God did not ſee it; God looked on him as cloathed with the Righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo is ſaid, not to ſee it.</p>
                  <p>As the Sun ſhining through a red glaſſe upon a wall, the wall looks red: not that this colour is inherent in it; but relucent upon it: So God looking on us through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> doth behold us Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Righteouſneſs; not that this is inherent in us, or beheld in us; as the Papiſts charge us, but <hi>quoad gratioſum Dei conſpectum,</hi> wee are rather beheld in it.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, there are ſome, beſides Papiſts, that deny the imputation of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Righteouſneſſe, and ſay too much with them,<note place="margin">Iuſtitiam puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tativam.</note>

                  <p>Wee ſay there is a twofold Righteouſneſſe in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>His eſſential and perſonal Righteouſneſs,</hi> as God.</p>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:97371:45"/>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe cannot bee imputed to us; it is eſſential, but the latter of theſe <hi>(Juſtitia Mediatoria)</hi> his Mediatory Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or that Righteouſneſſe hee wrought for us as <hi>Mediator,</hi> whereby hee did ſubject himſelf to the <hi>Precepts,</hi> to the <hi>Penalties, Commands,</hi> and <hi>Curſes;</hi> anſwering both Gods <hi>vindictive</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding Juſtice;</hi> This is communicated to us, and made ours, by vertue of which wee ſtand <hi>recti in curia,</hi> juſtified in Gods ſight, which is the firſt beauty <hi>Christ</hi> adorns his Church withall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond beauty wherewith <hi>Chriſt</hi> adorns his Church, and makes her lovely, is, The <hi>Beauties of his Graces;</hi> which may bee called the <hi>Beauties of Holineſs,</hi> and ſet forth to us by thoſe <hi>Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,</hi> and <hi>chains,</hi> Ezek. 16.9. and here by <hi>one Chain, &amp;c.</hi> which is communicated to us, by way of <hi>Infuſion,</hi> or <hi>Emanation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his Spirit, doth derive from himſelf as the <hi>univerſal Principle,</hi> and <hi>common ſtock of Grace; Grace for Grace,</hi> according to that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs wee have all received Grace for Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know there are many interpretations of this. <hi>Chryſoſtome. The Goſpel for the Law,</hi> becauſe it follows, <hi>The Law came by</hi> Moſes.</p>
                  <p>Others, <hi>Gratiam, ſuper Gratiam,</hi> or <hi>Gratiam gratiae accumulatam,</hi> one grace to another, or abundance of Grace.</p>
                  <p>But this I conceive the meaning. For every Grace that is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there is ſome Grace communicated to us anſwerable to it, in ſome proportion. As the Child in Generation receives from the Parents member for member; or as the Paper from the Preſſe, letter for letter; or the Glaſſe from the face, image for image; or the Wax from the Seal, ſtamp for ſtamp: ſo wee from <hi>Chriſt, Grace for Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no Grace in <hi>Chriſt</hi> appertaining to our ſanctification in general, which is not in ſome weak degree faſhioned in us. And hence the work of Grace and Regeneration is called a <hi>forming of Chriſt</hi> in the ſoul. And whiles wee behold him, wee are ſaid to bee <hi>changed into his likeneſſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. And wee are ſaid to have <hi>the ſame Spirit in us,</hi> that is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, hee is none of his.</hi> And the <hi>ſame Mind</hi> is in us, that is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 2.6.</p>
                  <p>There is a baſtardly holineſs, a painted falſe beauty, which is ſpun out of our ſelves, wrought out of our own Principles, with which wee ſhall lye down with ſorrow at laſt. Sparkles of our own kindling.</p>
                  <p>But the true holineſſe flows from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and is imparted from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> whereby ſhee is beautifull with his beauties, adorned with his Graces. And being thus, the Heart of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> muſt needs bee taken with her.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the ſecond Reaſon, why the Heart of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſo much taken. <hi>Becauſe ſhee is adorned with his Beauties, cloathed with his Righteouſneſs, adorned and beautified with his Graces;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth the Heart of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee that loved us in our own blood, cannot chuſe but love us, as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97371:46"/> wee have his beauty put upon us; hee cannot but love himſelf, and delight in himſelf, where-ever hee doth behold himſelf: why theſe beauties are peeces of himſelf, part of his beauty, his rayes wherewith hee himſelf is adorned. And hee cannot look upon any ſoul cloathed with his Righteouſneſs, and beautified with his Graces, but his heart is exceedingly taken with them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>Turn away thine eyes from mee, for they have overcome mee. Chriſt</hi> ſeems as not able to bear the view of ſuch a beauty. <hi>Turn away thine eyes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are the perſons, upon whom God intended to advance the great deſign of glorifying the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now thoſe whom God hath intended for ſo great purpoſes, as theſe are, which are the <hi>greateſt Purpoſes</hi> that ever came upon his heart, his heart muſt needs bee taken withall. You know the more glorious and excellent the <hi>End</hi> to which any thing ſerves, the more precious is that <hi>thing</hi> in our eyes. Now wee ſerve for no other <hi>End,</hi> but the expreſſion of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> the advancement of the <hi>Glory</hi> of his <hi>Free-Grace,</hi> which are <hi>Ends</hi> as high as himſelf, <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes</hi> as great as himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And therefore God is not only taken with the expreſſion of it, but with the perſons upon whom hee doth expreſſe it. Therefore I ſay is <hi>the Heart of God ſo exceedingly taken with his Church.</hi>

                  <p>Indeed God may ſingle out ſome men for the purpoſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the glory of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the advancement of them; and yet God hate the men, as you ſee it plain in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who for this cauſe was ſet up to advance his <hi>Power.</hi> But God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſingled out any to bee the ſubjects on whom hee doth intend to advance the <hi>Riches of his Grace and Mercy;</hi> but his Heart is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly taken with them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe, who ſerve to ſuch high purpoſes as theſe, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſuch high ends as theſe; <hi>The advancement of the Glory of his Grace and Free-Mercy</hi> (which is the moſt precious attribute of God, and which ſome think is called his <hi>Glory,</hi> Exod. 33.18. <hi>Let mee ſee thy Glory,</hi>) and if the 19. verſe may interpret it, that Glory was his Mercy, and his Mercy his Glory; and therefore ſuch muſt needs bee precious in his eſteem.</p>
                  <p>Now his People are they, whom God hath ſingled out for theſe great purpoſes, for the <hi>Expreſſion</hi> of more <hi>Mercy,</hi> than wee can <hi>expreſs,</hi> nay, than wee can <hi>conceive,</hi> nay, than wee can <hi>beleeve</hi> at all times, but weakly at beſt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>the Heart of Jeſus Christ muſt needs bee taken with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Brethren, If God had not ſingled out ſome to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus upon, God had not been <hi>known in the World;</hi> for there is nothing ſo much reveals God to bee God, as his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore God ſingled out a few upon whom hee would
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97371:46"/> advance the riches of his Grace, that his Mercy, and in that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might bee made known in the World.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. that <hi>hee obtained Mercy,</hi> that hee might ſtand up a <hi>Pattern of all long-ſuffering.</hi> As if hee had ſaid. Wee ſhould not have known how patient God is, wee ſhould not have apprehended how long-ſuffering God is to ſinners, if hee had not had ſuch an example of patience, ſuch a pattern of all long-ſuffering, as I was: So wee ſhould not have known how <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,</hi> how <hi>Good</hi> God is, if the choiceſt attribute of God had been loſt to us; like as if a great River had run under ground not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; if God had not ſingled out ſome, upon whom hee might have expreſſed the <hi>Riches</hi> of his <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thoſe whom God doth intend to bee the ſubjects upon whom hee may advance ſo high deſigns, ſo great purpoſes, muſt needs bee exceeding precious to him.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, you that are the <hi>People of God,</hi> are ſuch as hee hath intended to advance his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Glory of Free-Grace upon;</hi> You are they hee ſent <hi>Chriſt</hi> to dye for, the greateſt work that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was wrought in the World. You are they whom hee reared the fabrick of Heaven for. You are they in whom hee intends to delight, and with whom hee will ſolace himſelf for ever.</p>
                  <p>And God looks upon us now, not as wee are, but what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make us. Hee ſees to the utmoſt of his deſign on you, to eternity, and loves you now with that love.</p>
                  <p>If God ſhould look upon us, as wee are, hee might ſee enough in us, to withdraw his heart from us: or if not, yet enough to cool and quench his affections towards us; being there is ſo much blackneſſe with our beauty, ſo much deformity with our comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo much corruption with our Graces: Nay, ſo much black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo little beauty, and ſo much corruption, and ſo little Grace.</p>
                  <p>But hee looks upon us, not as wee are in our ſelves, but as wee are in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not what wee are for preſent, but what hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make us in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Hee looks to the end of his deſign, even to that which hee hath deſigned us to. — When wee ſhall bee preſented <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing: holy, and without blemiſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5.27. — When wee ſhall bee <hi>ſatisfied with his likeneſs,</hi> Pſal. 17.15. — When wee ſhall bee <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore God having intended us to ſuch high purpoſes, and looking upon us for preſent, what hee purpoſes to make us, and what hee hath deſigned us to; needs muſt the Heart of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> bee taken with us.</p>
                  <p>Thus having ſhewed you, what it is to have the Heart of <hi>Chriſt</hi> taken with the Church; and proved unto you that the Heart of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is thus taken with it; and given you the grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97371:47"/> of it; I will now deſcend to application;</p>
                  <p>If ſo bee, that <hi>the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt be taken with his Church and People:</hi> Then from hence wee may deduce theſe <hi>Conſectaries.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. This then may bee a ground for us to expect, and hence our Faith may bee ſtrengthened in the expectation, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will yet do more for his Church and People, than yet hee hath done.</p>
                     <p>Indeed hee hath done much for <hi>our Nation,</hi> for <hi>our Engliſh Sion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee might have <hi>ruined</hi> us, for a Generation of ſuch as provoked him. Wee have been a <hi>Provocation of his Anger</hi> to this day. Hee might have <hi>ſuffered our carkaſſes to have fallen in the Wilderneſs,</hi> and kept our poſterity to have entered into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Wee have looked toward <hi>Egypt,</hi> toward <hi>Babylon.</hi> Hee might have laid the foundation of purer times in our bloud, raiſed up a purer Church upon the ruines of us.</p>
                     <p>But God hath ſeemed to over-look our great unworthineſs: And to the terror of our enemies, and even to the aſtoniſhment and wonder of us all, hath begun, ſet forth, and gone forward in a way of mercy; ſuch wayes as have been untrodden in former times.</p>
                     <p>And that which God hath given us in hand, is an earneſt of what wee have in hope: that wee have in poſſeſſion bids us but look to what wee have in promiſe.</p>
                     <p>And expect the performance of it, becauſe God loves the Church: <hi>the Heart of Chriſt is taken with the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee loves his Church, and therefore hee will purifie his Church, aad take away her droſs and tinne.</p>
                     <p>Hee loves his Church, and therefore will hee reform his Church.</p>

                     <p>That love which made him ingage himſelf to his Church, in precious promiſes, will not ſuffer him to reſt, till hee hath made good thoſe promiſes to it.</p>

                     <p>You ſee in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.27. the whole Chapter is but an addition of Mercy to Mercy.</p>
                     <p>When God begins to go forth towards a people, in a way of mercy, hee knows no ſtop, hee can make no end. I will <hi>do this,</hi> and alſo <hi>this,</hi> as you ſee in that Chapter. God adds <hi>Mercy,</hi> to <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe Free-love begins, and that knows no end.</p>
                     <p>The proceedings of Gods Mercy, towards his Church and People, do ariſe from himſelf, his own <hi>Free-Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His <hi>Juſtice</hi> is from us; but his <hi>Mercy</hi> is from himſelf.</p>
                     <p>If, when hee threatned to puniſh <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee ſaith, hee will adde <hi>Judgement</hi> to <hi>Judgement. This, and this alſo</hi> will I do, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12.

                     </p>
                     <p>God hath <hi>Alſo's of Mercy,</hi> as well as of <hi>Judgement.</hi> See in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.27. <hi>My Tabernacle alſo ſhall bee, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Well then: Is <hi>the Heart of Chriſt taken with his Church and People?</hi> Then will wee with confidence beleeve, and with patience wait and expect, that <hi>Chriſt will yet do more for his Church and People, than ever hee hath done, becauſe hee loves them?</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>I never read, that ever God beſtowed any <hi>great Mercy</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance upon his Church and People, but he firſt ſtirred up the hearts of his people <hi>mightily</hi> to pray unto him.</p>
                     <p>And never did God <hi>mightily ſtir up the hearts</hi> of his People <hi>to ſeek him,</hi> but hee wrought ſome <hi>great Mercy</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi> for them.</p>
                     <p>God loves to make his People as <hi>thankful</hi> as they were <hi>prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> As <hi>happy Injoyers,</hi> as they were <hi>humble Seekers.</hi> When <hi>Trouble</hi> ſends us to <hi>Prayer,</hi> then <hi>Deliverance</hi> ſhall ſend us to <hi>Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>

                        <p>I ſay, God may in part forſake his People, which may bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned on their part, by ſome freſh and new-acted ſin. As you ſee it was with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.1. <hi>David</hi> had ſinned: God had withdrawn himſelf. God was gone, comfort was gone, light was gone for a time. <hi>Works of Darkneſs, and walking in Darkneſs</hi> went together.

                        <p n="1">1. God may forſake a man in part, in reſpect of his <hi>Quickening</hi> preſence, and leave a man to the barrenneſs, flatneſs, deadneſs of his own ſpirit for a time, that the ſoul cannot pray, hear, meditate, do any thing, as formerly it hath done. As it was with <hi>Sampſon</hi> when his locks were cut, his ſtrength was gone; and therefore though hee thought to go out, and do as hee did in former times, yet hee found there was no ſuch matter; hee was become even as another man: ſo it is here; <hi>our ſtrength lyes, not in our hair, but in our head.</hi> When God is gone, our <hi>Locks</hi> are <hi>cut,</hi> our <hi>ſtrength</hi> is <hi>gone.</hi> And though wee may think to go upon duties, as at other times, and meet with thoſe lively and vigorous workings of ſpirit in duty: yet wee ſhall finde no ſuch matter; wee are even become as other men.</p>
                        <p>Indeed ſo much of his <hi>Quickening Spirit</hi> God leaves in the worſt of times, as uſually, to keep up the heart to duty. The ſoul will pray, will read, &amp;c. but hee gives not ſo much, as to carry the ſoul through the duty, with that life and vigour of affection, which formerly it had.</p>
                        <p>Time was, that the ſoul never came to prayer without an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med heart, never upon the duty, without a quick and inlarged ſoul. But now the ſpirit is dead in duty, cold in duty, heartleſs in the performance of thoſe things, wherein the heart was ſo much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God may forſake a man in reſpect of his <hi>Comforting preſence.</hi>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:97371:49"/> Though man is not able to rob us of our comforts, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our joyes, they are ſuch as the armes of men are not long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reach; yet God hee can. Hee may eclipſe our joyes, and damp our comforts, and withdraw the beams of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from us, and leave us in darkneſs and trouble. I ſay, hee may turn our <hi>Day</hi> into <hi>Night,</hi> our <hi>Light</hi> into <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> into <hi>Diſcomforts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee it was with <hi>Job,</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> with <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. who, although <hi>they had the Quickening-preſence of God,</hi> yet they wanted his <hi>Comforting-preſence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed of the two, it is better to want the <hi>Comforting,</hi> than the <hi>Quickening-preſence.</hi> Better to want <hi>Comfort</hi> than <hi>Life; Joies</hi> than <hi>Graces,</hi> or the lively exerciſe of them. The one is the <hi>Eſſe,</hi> the other but the <hi>Bene Eſſe</hi> of a Chriſtian. A man may live, and ſerve God, and obey him; and yet want his <hi>Comforting-preſence;</hi> as you ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. But hee cannot live without his <hi>Quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-preſence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. God may forſake a man in part, in reſpect of his <hi>Quickening-preſence,</hi> and hee may more forſake a man in reſpect of his <hi>Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-preſence:</hi> But God doth never forſake us in reſpect of his <hi>Supporting-preſence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſaddeſt condition, in the darkeſt night, in the ſtormieſt day, the ſoul hath ſtill ſupport from him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>David, Job, Heman,</hi> they wanted the <hi>Comforting-preſence of God</hi> for a time; but yet they had his <hi>Quickening,</hi> and they had his <hi>Supporting preſence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As hee told <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo hee did for all. <hi>His ſtrength was ſeen in their weakneſs, and his Grace was ſufficient for them.</hi> Sufficient to bear them up in the tryal, and ſufficient to bring them out of the tryal. So much for the ſecond <hi>Concluſion.</hi>

                        </p>

                     <p>This is certain. Whatever is done in the World, is done either by <hi>Gods Permiſsion,</hi> or by <hi>Gods Approbation.</hi> God muſt either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or allow of what ever is done in the World.</p>
                     <p>And aſſure your ſelves, God would never permit, much leſs would hee ever allow, and approve of any thing to bee done in the World, which ſhould not bee for the good of thoſe hee loves ſo dearly.</p>
                     <p>Whatever wind blows, bee it North, or South, good or evil; all is for the Churches benefit. As the Phyſitian ordereth poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

                     <p>How grievous would it bee to you, to bee forced to take hard courſes with a <hi>Child</hi> your heart is taken withall? though it bee to do him good.</p>
                     <p>Why God is taken with his Church, and do you not think it moves God to afflict and chaſtiſe it?</p>
                     <p>Wee would fain do all the good wee can to the perſons wee love. Oh! wee can never do enough for them. Why ſo it is with God to his Church: Hee loves his Church, and willingly would hee do any thing for it. And it is the grief of his ſoul, that hee muſt take contrary courſes with us, to do us good: that hee muſt bee forced to afflict and chaſtiſe them hee loves ſo dearly: to bring them to <hi>Life</hi> by <hi>Death,</hi> to <hi>Good</hi> by <hi>Evil,</hi> to a <hi>Crown</hi> by <hi>Croſſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When God parted with the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> you ſee what a conflict there was in him: how his bowels ſtirred, and were moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, notwithſtanding all their ſins, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up,</hi> Ephraim! <hi>How ſhall I deliver thee,</hi> Iſrael! <hi>How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah! <hi>How ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim! <hi>My heart is turned within mee; my repentings are kindled together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How loath was God to ſeal to a <hi>Bill of Divorce!</hi> His heart
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97371:51"/> loved her, though ſhee was an <hi>Adultreſs</hi> to him.</p>
                     <p>And when <hi>Judah</hi> did juſtifie the ſin of her Siſter <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding her in Idols, what <hi>trouble</hi> was it to <hi>God</hi> to <hi>caſt her off!</hi> How willing was hee to receive her after all her adulteries? <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt plaid the Harlot, &amp;c.</hi> And when ſhee would go on in her adulteries: yet how unwilling ſtill was hee to give her up? till at laſt it grew ſo high, that <hi>there was no Remedy,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. hee muſt needs do it.</p>
                     <p>And when hee had done it, how exceedingly was Gods heart moved, that hee muſt bee forced to deal ſo hardly with them hee loved ſo dearly? read <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.7, 8.9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See how God laments over the loſs of that which their ſins would not give him leave to keep. — <hi>I have forſaken mine houſe! I have left mine heritage! I have given the dearly beloved of my ſoul into the hand of her enemies!</hi> And what was it that forced God to deal ſo hardly with them hee loved ſo dearly? Why it was ſin, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. Hee ſent Meſſengers, becauſe hee had compaſſion on them: <hi>They mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſ-uſed his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; until the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his People, till there was no Remedy.</hi> And which of theſe hath remained to bee done among us? How hath our Sun been darkened, the Stars loſt their light! How many <hi>burning and ſhining lights</hi> have been taken out of our <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> and planted in others! How many blown out by the rage of wicked men!</p>
                     <p>Did wee not juſtly fear, by reaſon of that <hi>Idolatry, Superſtition, Prophanation of Sabbaths, Perſecution of the Saints, and Meſſengers of God,</hi> that <hi>our day was gone; our night approaching?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Did wee not fear, that wee were come up to this, <hi>that there was no remedy?</hi> That God ſhould have opened the <hi>Sluces</hi> of his wrath, and let in a <hi>Sea</hi> of his diſpleaſure upon us? made us an <hi>Aceldema, a field of Blood,</hi> long before this?</p>

                     <p>Look upon the paſſages of us to God, and his wayes towards us; and ſee how unwilling hee declared himſelf.

                     <p>And how can wee better anſwer Gods dealings towards us, than to <hi>abandon that, caſt out that</hi> which was our fear, and gave God juſt occaſion to deſtroy us?

                     </p>
                     <p>God hath done great things for us; and from this they have ariſen: His Heart is taken with us, his Love towards us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3, 4. <hi>I loved thee with an everlaſting love; — therefore with loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alas! If God had looked upon us, and taken either <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>motive</hi> from any thing in us, to do this for us, wee ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have injoyed it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There was no ground, no foundation of deſert in us. <hi>(Wee abhorre the thoughts of it)</hi> for God to raiſe ſuch a fabrick of mercy upon, as hee hath done.</p>
                     <p>If any thing in his Church were the foundation of the ſtructure of mercy, which wee expect God to raiſe, wee might look for a <hi>mean building.</hi> Such weak foundations muſt have as weak a ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. A building muſt bee proportionable to the foundation. But ſeeing Gods own heart is the foundation; his own mercy and good will towards us, which is ſo ſtrong, ſo firm, ſo full a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Hence it is, that wee may expect a ſtructure of mercy ſuitable to the foundation.</p>
                     <p>And, as this is the foundation of all thoſe <hi>great and ſtupendious things,</hi> which God hath done for us: So it is a ground for us to expect, that God will yet do <hi>greater things</hi> for us, than ever hee hath done.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, when wee look upon our ſelves, wee are at an end in our thoughts, and think God is at an <hi>end in his Mercy:</hi> but when wee look up toward God, and ſee there the ground of what wee have, this keeps up our hearts from ſinking, and cauſes us to look upon all wee have, as an <hi>earneſt of more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men that are at the top of an high place, if they look downwards, their eyes dazle, and their heads grow dizzy: but if they look up towards Heaven, they recover themſelves again. God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us up to ſome height of mercy; and if wee look downwards, if wee look <hi>upon our ſelves,</hi> wee are driven paſt the utmoſt of our thoughts: but let us look up to Heaven, whence this mercy wee have, hath its ſpring and foundation, and wee ſhall quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
                     <p>Though there bee nothing in us; yet there is ſomething in God; and that which is in God is the ground of this mercy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will hee go on in the wayes of his own mercy.</p>
                     <p>I have often thought within my ſelf; how far God at this time
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97371:53"/> hath out-gone his people in Mercy.</p>
                     <p>Hee hath not only out-gone the <hi>deſervings</hi> of his People, but out-gone the <hi>deſires</hi> of his people, the <hi>prayers</hi> of his People. And conſulting below, I am ready to think <hi>God is at an end of his Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, when I recover my ſelf, and look upon the <hi>ground of Gods</hi> doing good to his Church and People: <hi>Not to bee any goodneſs in the Church:</hi> but <hi>meerly his own goodneſs:</hi> This doth revive mee again; put heart into mee that God will yet <hi>do greater things</hi> for his Church, than yet hee hath done.</p>
                     <p>As I ſaid before; when God doth execute <hi>Judgements</hi> upon his Church, hee adds <hi>Judgement</hi> to <hi>Judgement:</hi> ſo much more, when hee comes in a way of <hi>Mercy</hi> to his Church, hee adds <hi>Mercy</hi> to <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God is oftentimes weary in going on in a way of <hi>Judgement,</hi> becauſe the exerciſe of his <hi>Judgements</hi> are drawn out by us, our ſins. Hee is ſaid <hi>not to afflict willingly:</hi> and his <hi>Judgements</hi> hee calls <hi>his strange work.</hi> It is not ſo natural to God, and therefore he is quickly weary of it.</p>
                     <p>But God is never weary of the exerciſe of his <hi>Mercie;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee goes on to adde <hi>Mercy</hi> to <hi>Mercy.</hi> Wee ſay, <hi>the Bee</hi> gives <hi>Hony</hi> naturally; the <hi>ſting</hi> only, when ſhee is forced to it: So God, it is natural to him to ſhew <hi>Mercy,</hi> but hee is provoked to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>Judgement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence hee is called <hi>the Father of Mercies,</hi> begets <hi>Mercy. Mercy</hi> is the <hi>Iſſue of God,</hi> moſt natural to <hi>God;</hi> and being ſo, hence <hi>Mercy pleaſeth him. Actions of Nature</hi> are <hi>Actions of Delight.</hi> God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo well pleaſed with any carriage towards his Church, as thoſe which are in the wayes of mercy.</p>
                     <p>Nay, if hee do afflict his Church, it is to <hi>ſhew Mercy.

                     <p>Indeed, if <hi>Acceptation</hi> ſhould ariſe from the <hi>worthineſs</hi> of our duties, wee ſhould never look to bee accepted. There is ſo much ſin in our ſervices, ſo much evil in our good, ſo much coldneſs in our beſt heats, ſo much formality in our chiefeſt power, ſo much deadneſs in our beſt life, ſo much of the World, ſo much of our earth in our imployments for Heaven.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wouldeſt</hi> thou know whether thou art one with whom <hi>Chriſts</hi> heart is taken? See whether thou art of his Church. Art thou one, who art taken out of the World? Art thou one, whom God hath called? one whom hee hath juſtified? one whom hee hath

                     <p>Theſe might bee in the <hi>general;</hi> but are too obſcure. But I will name you but one, and it is a plain one, and none more <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative.</hi>

                        <hi>Art thou one, whoſe heart is taken with Chriſt?</hi> If <hi>Chriſt</hi> bee taken with thee, thou art taken with <hi>Christ.</hi> It is a mutual, a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal taking. Whatever God doth to the ſoul, it makes an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the ſoul of the like to God. God delights in us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon wee come to delight in him.

                     </p>
                     <p>All love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth ariſe from diſcoveries and manifeſtations of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the ſoul. Either from the diſcoveries of thoſe beauties, thoſe attractive excellencies that are in him, or with that, from the diſcovery of his heart and good will towards us.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>blind men</hi> cannot diſcern of <hi>beauties;</hi> nor ignorant men of the beauties of <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> is to them as a <hi>Mine of Gold</hi> covered over with earth and rubbiſh: as a <hi>Bed of Pearl and Diamonds</hi> hid with an heap of ſand: as a <hi>glorious Meſſiah</hi> under a contemptible outſide.

                     <p>Now then, art thou one who <hi>knows Chriſt?</hi> did ever God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal him to thee in a promiſe? what apparitions hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> made to thy ſoul? what manifeſtations? what diſcoveries that may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to thee, that thou knoweſt him?</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:97371:56"/>
                     <p>There are <hi>four manifeſtations,</hi> or diſcoveries of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the ſoul, which do exceedingly take the ſoul. Indeed every appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth take the heart: but at theſe times the heart is not only wooed and won, but <hi>overcome</hi> with his ſweetneſs and glory.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>After the ſoul hath long lyen bedrid in ſorrow,</hi> been overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the deeps of <hi>Legal Humiliation,</hi> and have been broken and ſhattered in peeces with conſternation, and apprehenſions of ſin, and Gods wrath for it. Then a diſcovery of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the ſoul, is a reſurrection from the dead.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes by a promiſe into the ſoul, and diſplaies his glory, the <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of his <hi>Grace,</hi> as to <hi>Moſes; The Lord God, gracious and mercifull, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſsion and ſin,</hi> Exod. 34.6. <hi>I, I am hee who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth thy iniquities, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 43.25. Then is the ſoul beyond expreſſion, inamoured with him; now it is overcome with his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and excellencies, and even raviſhed with his love. And this is the firſt <hi>eminent taking</hi> of the heart with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>When the ſoul hath been upon the ſtormy Sea of temptations and deſertions;</hi> hath long laboured under the ſenſe of Gods withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and abſence from the ſoul. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> returns again, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dark and thick cloud, and ſhining into the ſoul. Who can then expreſſe the warmth, the comfort, the revivings, the holy heats and flames of love and affection to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee how it was with <hi>Job. I have heard of thee with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ear:</hi> But <hi>now mine eyes ſee thee.</hi> And certainly the ſight of his beauties did take him: thoſe eyes which ſaw him were like a burning-glaſſe to the heart, to kindle the flames and fervors of holy affections towards him again.</p>
                     <p>You ſee how it was with the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had withdrawn himſelf: Shee makes inquiry after him, but could not hear of him. At laſt after all her trouble, <hi>Chriſt</hi> appears to her ſoul. And you may read there, how exceedingly her heart was taken with his return. <hi>I found him whom my ſoul loveth; I held him, and would not let him go, untill I had brought him into my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe,</hi> Cant. 3.4.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>When the ſoul doth ſit down to contemplate,</hi> and read over the beauties and loves of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> when it is in the contemplations of thoſe <hi>ſurpaſsing excellencies, and admired ſweetneſs</hi> which is in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> (whiles the ſoul is buſy in feeding on theſe thoughts) doth make a diſcovery of himſelf to the ſoul: makes the ſoul to ſee a viſion of his glory: <hi>Oh! how is the heart taken with him!</hi> it is even drowned and ſunk in a Sea of glory. <hi>Ah!</hi> what <hi>claſping,</hi> what <hi>imbraces!</hi> what <hi>loves</hi> are there then betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the ſoul!

                     <p>So here, it is nothing but ignorance of better things which makes us dote upon things here below. Did wee ſee his beauties, all the World would bee blackneſs. Did wee ſee his fulneſs, all the World were but emptineſs.</p>

                     <p>If you go to the top of the Mountains, men would appear but ſmall: but if it were poſſible to go up to the Sun, the Mountains would appear nothing.</p>
                     <p>The love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath a <hi>raiſing-power,</hi> working our hearts as high as Heaven, and being there, all things here below are of no account and eſteem to the ſoul.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97371:57"/> taken withall; whether your comforts, your delights, your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies not in them. The Worldling hee lives in his poſſeſſions.

                     <p>I ſay, if thy heart bee taken with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thou liveſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> more than in thy ſelf. Thy life, thy comforts, thy happineſs, they are all folded up in him.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Judah</hi> ſaid of <hi>Benjamin. Jacobs life was bound up in the Lads life,</hi> Gen. 44.30.

                     <p>Which makes the life of a Chriſtian ſo ſafe, none can hurt him, and ſo ſweet too, being a life in Chriſt out of himſelf. The beſt of others lyes in themſelves: but the beſt of a Chriſtian, thoſe precious things in him, lies out of himſelf, and lies in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Act of prizing Chriſt,</hi> that wee do not mean <hi>a bare and naked Eſtimate of Chriſt,</hi> in the <hi>Underſtanding:</hi> but ſuch an one as prevails with the ſoul, and commands the ſpirit of a man <hi>to do actions conſonant and agreeable to that rate the Judgement ſet on Chriſt.</hi> I ſay, by <hi>prizing of Chriſt,</hi> wee do not mean <hi>a bare acts of Dijudication,</hi> what a man in his Judgement may conclude <hi>Chriſt</hi> to bee worth. Many bee, that will tell you, they conclude <hi>Chriſt</hi> to bee worth a World: who yet will not part with any thing for <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I mean ſuch an act of the underſtanding, as brings up <hi>the Heart,</hi> and the affections to cloſe with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in that height which the <hi>Underſtanding rates him at.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay, ſuch an <hi>Act of Appretiation</hi> as prevails with a man to do actions conſonant and agreeable to the rate it pretends to ſet on <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As you ſee the <hi>wiſe Merchant.</hi> Hee did not barely <hi>judge</hi> that the Pearl was worth all hee had: but hee did <hi>Actions conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and agreeable to it.

                     <p>That is the firſt. A ſoul taken with <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not only bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge and eſteem <hi>Chriſt</hi> worth all; but will part with all for the compaſſing of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Here is ſomething conſiderable in the Object. Chriſt prized.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1.

The <hi>dignity</hi> of his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> being <hi>God-Man,</hi> having all beauties and excellencies in him. This may raiſe up a kinde of eſteem of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the hearts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither do wee limit it only to the <hi>Benefits of Chriſt,</hi> and the great things which hee hath done for man in general, in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97371:58"/> his humiliation, death, paſſion, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But wee are to take <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>extent of Chriſt: Chriſt</hi> in his whole <hi>Latitude: Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Holineſs, Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Laws, Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Government, Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Truth, Totum Chriſti,</hi> the <hi>whole of Chriſt.</hi> Hee that prizeth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his whole latitude, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, doth not prize <hi>Chriſt</hi> at all as hee ought to do.</p>
                     <p>As wee ſay of <hi>Faith;</hi> it doth not <hi>eligere Objectum,</hi> it doth not chuſe its Object, ſingle out what it will eſteem, and what not: but prizeth of <hi>Chriſt</hi> fully in the latitude and extent of <hi>Christ,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Perſon, Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Beauties, Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Laws,</hi> in his <hi>Holineſs, Truth, Government:</hi> And ſo highly, that they <hi>ſold</hi> themſelves to <hi>gain a Truth; loſt</hi> themſelves to <hi>ſave a Truth:</hi> They have made this brave adventure, thrown away themſelves, that they might keep up a Truth; as you ſee it in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, in <hi>point of Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> So that is the ſecond. The ſoul taken with <hi>Chriſt</hi> is taken with <hi>All-Chriſt.</hi> As all in him is lovely: ſo the ſoul loves all; and prizes and eſteems of all of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That which is conſiderable in the Meaſure is,</hi> That a ſoul taken with <hi>Chriſt, doth prize Chriſt above all comforts and contents in Heaven and Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Chriſt</hi> commands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any man will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mee, let him deny himſelf. If any]</hi> It is ſet down indefinitly. Not only you, who are poor, and have little to loſe, and deny your ſelves in: but they, who have moſt. You that are rich, you that have lands, poſſeſſions, have <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters.</hi> If any poor, any rich, any beggar, any Prince, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hee muſt deny himſelf]</hi> Not only in things unlawfull, but law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Hee muſt yeeld up his ſins as a ſnare; his comforts, eſtate, and all as a Sacrifice for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if hee call for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. <hi>Hee that loves Father or Mother more than mee, is not worthy of mee.</hi> Theſe relations are expreſſed: but under theſe are comprized all the comforts and contents on earth.</p>
                     <p>And this was not only commanded, but it is practiſed by thoſe, whoſe hearts are taken with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> You ſee in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who left all; in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who prized more of the reproach of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than all the treaſures in <hi>Egypt;</hi> in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee! or in Earth, in compariſon of thee!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the World would bee nothing elſe but <hi>Angiae ſtabulum;</hi> a noiſome ſink, a priſon to a godly man, were it not that hee injoys ſomething of <hi>Chriſt</hi> here: So Heaven it ſelf were but a <hi>gaudy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, Vanity,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> were not there.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Heaven,</hi> which carnal men do fanſy is a <hi>Turkiſh-Heaven,</hi> an heaven of pleaſures, delights, comforts, but fleſhly, outward. They conceive of it, according to their <hi>Principle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Heaven of a godly</hi> man, it lies in God, it lies in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Indeed</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That is not Heaven, which is by God; but that is Heaven,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97371:58"/> which lies in God,</hi> to a godly man.</p>
                     <p>It was the meditation of one: Not <hi>Heaven, O Lord; but God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Non coelum Domine, ſed Deus &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus doth the ſoul, that is taken with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> prize <hi>Chriſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the comforts, contentments of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi>

If thy heart bee taken with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thy <hi>thoughts</hi> are taken up with him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is alwayes upon thy thoughts; hee lies next to thy heart; when thou goeſt to bed hee is with thee, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.13. and when thou awakeſt hee is with thee; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.18.</p>
                     <p>Indeed Gods people may have ſwarms of other thoughts; but they are not entertained, they are not welcome to them; they are their burden, and trouble. They come in as Intruders, and are not entertained as <hi>Gueſts.</hi> A wicked man entertains them as <hi>Gueſts,</hi> as friends; but they come into a godly man, as intruders, never invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor finde they welcome. This is that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks.<note place="margin">Jer. 4.14.</note>

                     <p>And as the <hi>Thoughts</hi> are taken up with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo the <hi>Tongue.</hi> Hee <hi>thinks,</hi> and hee <hi>ſpeaks Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in the heart, the tongue will diſcourſe and ſpeak of him. Whatever is in the heart, and the heart is taken withall, that a mans diſcourſe is moſt taken up withall. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.30. <hi>The mouth of the Righteous ſpeaketh wiſdome, and his Tongue talketh of Judgement.</hi> And why? <hi>becauſe the Law of his God is in his heart,</hi> verſ. 31.

                     <p n="1">1. And indeed wee cannot have a <hi>fuller Subject</hi> to diſcourſe on. Other Subjects they are empty ſubjects, quickly barren. Talk of what you will, you will bee quickly at an end. The bottome of other things are quickly ſounded.

                     <p n="2">2. You cannot have a <hi>ſweeter ſubject. Chriſt is All-ſweet: A Roſe without prickles. A Roſe, for ſweetneſs: without prickles, for content.</hi> And nothing is ſo but <hi>Chriſt.</hi> All the things of the world ſince the fall, have been <hi>Roſes beſet with thorns.</hi> Though there bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>ſweets</hi> in the World; yet they are not <hi>all-ſweet;</hi> they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with thorns: croſſes with comforts, and afflictions with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>Chriſt is All-ſweet,</hi> and nothing but <hi>ſweet.

                     <p>Others indeed, though they do a duty, yet as their hearts ſeek not <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the duty, ſo their ſouls can reſt content without him, when the duty is done: but it is otherwiſe with a right-born-ſoul.</p>
                     <p>'Twas the ſpeech of <hi>Bradford,</hi> that hee could never leave a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till hee had found communion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the duty: till hee had brought his heart into a <hi>duty-frame.</hi> Hee could not leave <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,</hi> till hee had found his heart touched, broken, and humbled for ſin; nor <hi>Petition,</hi> till hee had found his heart taken with the beauties of the things deſired, and carried out after them: nor could hee leave <hi>thankſgiving,</hi> till hee had found his ſpirit inlarged, and his ſoul quickened in the return of praiſes.</p>
                     <p>And it was the happineſs of <hi>Bernard,</hi> a Heaven upon Earth, that hee ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I never went from thee, without thee.</hi>

                     <p>Thus hee, whoſe heart is taken with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thirſts after communion with him, and no duty contents him, wherein hee hath not found either his <hi>quickening,</hi> or his <hi>comforting-preſence:</hi> either communion with his Grace, or communion with his comfort.</p>

                     <p>Whiles the ſoul is here, it ſees the diſtance too great betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and it, that ſhee cannot injoy that ſweet communion with him.

                     </p>
                     <p>Though in one ſenſe it is true; <hi>hee that beleeves makes not haſte;</hi> yet here hee that beleeves moſt, and loves moſt, makes moſt haſte.</p>
                     <p>The more the ſoul beleeves, and the more the heart is taken with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the greater are the deſires to bee with him.</p>

                        <hi>Till Simeon</hi> had gotten <hi>Chriſt</hi> into his armes, hee was unwilling to dye: but after hee had <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his armes; <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace; for my eyes have ſeen thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed here are but the <hi>Eſpouſals</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the ſoul. Some <hi>Broken-Rings, Contracts, Eſpouſals,</hi> betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us.

                     <p>Here wee do ſee him but <hi>dimly</hi> and <hi>darkly,</hi> at the beſt, and there are oftentimes clouds come in, and interpoſe themſelves, between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us: but then wee ſhall ſee him <hi>face to face,</hi> and never ſhall there cloud come between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us to all eternity.

                     <p>Here wee injoy him but in part. The diſtance is great betwixt him and us. All which diſtance doth ariſe from that within us. Were it not for <hi>ſin</hi> wee might bee in <hi>Glory,</hi> even in <hi>Grace.</hi> But then wee ſhall injoy him in <hi>fulneſs.</hi>

                     <p>The poſſeſſion of the thing beloved doth content the ſoul ſo far as there is ſatisfaction and contentment with it.

                     <p>But now it is not ſo with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Hee is able to brim the ſoul, to ſatisfie the ſpirit to anſwer all the deſires of the heart; and therefore the heart taken with him, needs muſt reſt ſatisfied and contented with him.</p>
                     <p>Such a gulf of deſire is in the ſoul of men, that if God ſhould caſt in a <hi>thouſand</hi> worlds, there would bee no contentment, except <hi>Chriſt</hi> bee caſt in.

                     </p>
                     <p>Do but ſit down, and from the ſight and ſenſe of thine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, take but occaſion to advance Free-Grace and Mercy. Let there bee place for that to come in. Let thoſe thoughts finde entertainment. And thou ſhalt quickly finde a ſtrange change in thy ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Thou, who couldeſt not mourn before, ſhall now bee able to poure our tears, as if thou wert all turned to water.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thou, who before couldeſt not beleeve, couldeſt not bee comforted, wilt even think it a wonder, that ever thy heart ſhould bee ſo dark, ſo doubtful.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thou, who before waſt dead, ſhalt now finde a ſpirit of life come into thee, and make thee active in the work of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Make but the <hi>Experiment,</hi> and thou wilt converſe more with the promiſe, with the Love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with the Free-Grace of <hi>God,</hi> whiles thou liveſt; if you would but remove your <hi>unbelief.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But who ſhall remove this ſtone? <hi>God</hi> alone muſt do it. But if this were done, this truth would let in a flood of mercy upon you; and even ſink and over-whelm you in a Sea of mercy and glory; where now you go drooping, and hang down your heads, becauſe you will not own that portion, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath left you; nor that comfort which <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth tender and ſpeak to you.</p>

                     <p>Whatever God doth to the ſoul, it makes an impreſſion in the ſoul of the ſame to God. Hee loves us, and thereupon wee love him; ſo his heart is taken with us, thereupon our hearts are taken with him. You ſee here the <hi>mutual Indeerments betwixt Chriſt and his Church,</hi> Cant. 5.16.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pauls</hi> heart was ſo much taken with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that hee was ever in his thoughts, ever upon his tongue. Hee names him ſixteen, or ſeventeen ſeveral times in one chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> notes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> did but let a word of <hi>Chriſt</hi> fall, and it is a <hi>door</hi> to open to further diſcourſe of him. Hee takes occaſion upon the naming of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97371:64"/> him, to enter into diſcourſe concerning him. As you ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7, 8. So greatly were their hearts taken with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they could think nothing but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſpeak nothing but <hi>Chriſt.</hi> No ſentence compleat, wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not part of it.</p>
                     <p>Hee was <hi>the one</hi> of their eſteems; <hi>the one</hi> of their affections; <hi>the one</hi> of their deſires; <hi>the one</hi> of their delights. And ſo ought hee to bee of ours.</p>
                     <p>Get your hearts taken with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this will make you <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed; this will make you humble, active, chearful <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An heart taken with <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Heaven on this ſide Heaven.</hi> An <hi>Heaven on Earth. Glory in Clay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> delights to walk.</p>
                     <p>It is the <hi>Houſe,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> delights to dwell.</p>
                     <p>It is the <hi>Throne,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſits in his glory.</p>
                     <p>It is the <hi>Habitation</hi> of the <hi>bleſſed Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the <hi>Delight</hi> of all the <hi>bleſsed Trinity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An heart taken with <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the humble ſoul indeed, is the active ſoul, the living ſoul, which breathes forth nothing but love and deſire after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is an heart dead to the world; for the World can never take that heart which once is taken with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> All is <hi>empty</hi> to him, whom <hi>fulneſs</hi> fills. All is <hi>blackneſs</hi> where <hi>Beauty ſhines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh! then get but an heart taken with him, and thou liveſt a <hi>Life of Glory,</hi> and a <hi>Life of Grace.</hi> This is the <hi>Porch of Glory,</hi> the <hi>ſuburbs of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I told you before, there were four ſpeciall times in which the heart was taken with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I might adde a fifth, which I hope is <hi>our times. — When Chriſt goes forth in his glory, for the redemption and deliverance of his Church, and puniſhment of his enemies:</hi> Then is the heart taken with him.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> never appears in his <hi>Glory</hi> to his Church; but hee makes his Church <hi>glorious.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have intended (with Gods aſſiſtance) to enter upon a Diſcourſe of Faith, which might laſt till we come to the place, where faith ſhall be no more. And although my preaching of faith may end before, yet your practiſing of it muſt not. <hi>The just ſhall live by faith,</hi> and the juſt muſt dye in faith.</p>
                  <p>This Text I have choſen for the foundation of this Diſcourſe: Which, before I come to handle in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I ſhall ſhew what coherence and dependance it hath with the former words. For which purpoſe, you muſt know that this Chapter, from the beginning to <hi>Verſe</hi> 22. contains a diſcourſe between Chriſt and <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> In which you may obſerve,

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The occaſion of this Diſcourſe moſt likely, was a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put by <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> which is not here expreſſed; but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably implyed in <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. in that it is ſaid, That <hi>Jeſus Anſwered;</hi> and by the Anſwer, you may gueſs what the Queſtion was. It

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have the Diſcourſe it ſelf: Which was partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and partly interrupted. Continued by Chriſt, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted by <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> in divers places, by his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Cavils, and fleſhly Reaſonings.</p>
                  <p>This Text is a part of Chriſts continued diſcourſe, and hath ſpecial relation to the foregoing verſe, <hi>As Moſes lift up, &amp;c. ſo must the Son of man be lifted up:</hi> Verſe 14. <hi>That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him, be he who he will, Jew or Gentile, bond or free, Barbarian, Scythian, &amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now about the Act and the Object, we ſhall make theſe two enquiries, before we come to lay down the Concluſion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>What act of faith that is, whereby a ſinner ſtands juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Upon what Object this Act is to be terminated?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the firſt, <hi>What Act that is?</hi> You muſt know, that faith in the general conſideration, hath divers acts and objects, and that the acts are diverſified, according to the diverſity of the objects: ſo many particulars as are recorded in Scripture, ſo many particular objects; and accordingly ſo many particular acts there are of faith in general. But our enquiry is, what is the formal Act and Object of juſtifying faith?</p>
                     <p>Now for the firſt; <hi>viz.</hi> What is the formal Act of Faith? You muſt know, that there is much difference amongſt Divines about it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some would have it to be a bare and naked aſſent to every truth revealed by God. Thus the Papiſts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some ſay it is a firm and radical aſſent to this great Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That Chriſt is Meſſiah and Saviour of the world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Others place it in a receiving of Chriſt in all his Offices, as a King, Prieſt, and Prophet.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Some in Aſſurance and Particular Knowledge, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97371:68"/> that we are in the ſtate of Grace, and have an intereſt in Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Others do place it in rowling our ſelves upon Chriſt, and reſting in him, when the ſoul aſſenting to that great Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Chriſt is the Saviour, the Mediator, doth rowl and reſt it ſelf upon him, and truſteth in him.</p>
                     <p>In moſt of which different opinions, we finde this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That it is an Act of Faith whereby wee are juſtified, not Faith as an Habit of Grace inherent in us, but Faith as an Act; not Faith <hi>in actu primo</hi> as an Habit infuſed; but <hi>in actu ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 That it is ſuch an Act as is not wrought out of our ſelves, or our own Principles, but ſuch as is wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, and the mighty Power of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That it is ſuch an Act as bringeth over the ſoul to the true object, to Chriſt, by whom wee are juſtified.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Such an one as all the benefits of Chriſt do belong unto; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Chriſt in blood, Chriſt in water, Chriſt for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſt for Sanctification, Chriſt for Salvation; in all theſe there is an exact agreement among them. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there bee ſome difference in reſpect of that formall Act which juſtifieth; yet ſeeing they preach, and cry down them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and advance and ſet up free grace, and mercy, both in the work and fruit of it; The Papiſts have no cauſe to cry us down for diſ-agreement, which for their parts, they are like the four winds blowing in the faces of one another in many points, as might eaſily bee ſhewed, if here it were pertinent.</p>
                     <p>Wee know, that while wee are here, differences there will bee, for wee know in part, and propheſy but in part. It were an happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hing if wee could bee all of one heart, and all of one mind, but ſeeing it will not bee. I could wiſh that although wee bee not all of one mind, yet wee might bee all of one heart, and that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in judgement, might not breed alienation in affection, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſeeing wee all aime at one thing, one mark, one end. All agree <hi>in hoc uno,</hi> in this one, to ſet up Chriſt, the mercy of God, free grace, and by crying down our ſelves, and why then ſhould wee not agree amongſt our ſelves?</p>
                     <p>And therefore in all theſe diverſities of Judgements concerning the formal Act of Faith, whereby wee ſtand juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God. I ſhall not deal ſo much in the throwing down of other mens opinions, as in the eſtabliſhing of mine own.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe I conceive there is little wiſdome in it, to uncover the nakedneſs of our Brethren, by bringing them in, contending with one another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe I think there is little profit in it, eſpecially in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Congregations. Such debates being fitter for the

Polemical and Controverſal points may beget Notion, little Motion; fill our heads with Notions, but not our hearts with ſanctifyed affections. And therefore I will break my ſelf in as plain and modeſt a manner as I can; amongſt all theſe differences to declare what I adhear to, and to eſtabliſh it by ſome Scriptures, and ſo paſſe it.</p>
                     <p>Now then I conceive that that formal act of Faith whereby wee are juſtifyed and inſtated into Chriſt, is an Act of Affiance, and <hi>recumbency, rowling reſting, truſting or Chriſt for Juſtification, and conſequently for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>

                        </gap>: Whence it is apparent, that to believe in God, is as much as to commit our ſelves to his truſt: for ſo it there followeth, <hi>I am perſwaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him,</hi> or depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with him, or delivered up unto his keeping to that day, that is, his ſoul to everlaſting life: So that we ſee, that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, is with confidence and truſt to rely upon him. And thus much for the formal act of faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

And faith in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. and Faith in the blood of Chriſt: Whence I thus argue:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Object to the Belief, of which juſtification and ſalvation is promiſed, that is the Object of juſtifying faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But to believe in Chriſt, is Juſtification and Salvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore Chriſt is the object of juſtifying faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, as briefly as I could, having ſhewed what is the formal both act and object of juſtifying faith, I ſhall now lay down this one Concluſion.</p>

Now according to the diverſity of opinions herein, ſuch is the diverſity of Definitions.</p>
                     <p>They who hold the <hi>Aſſent</hi> to bee the Act of Juſtifying Faith, define it to bee a firm and willing Aſſent to the truth of God in generall, and to this truth in particular, that Chriſt is the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and Saviour of the World. They who hold it to bee a receiving of Chriſt, define it to bee ſuch an Act, as whereby wee receive Chriſt in all his offices.</p>
                     <p>But not to trouble you with theſe. That which I will give you is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Definition.</note>Faith is an Act of a regenerate perſon, whereby knowing, and aſſenting unto the Promiſes of God, and to this Truth in particular, that Chriſt is the Meſſiah or Saviour of the World, doth reſt upon him for Juſtification, Sanctification, and conſequently for Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Now to explain this Definition.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 I ſay, that <hi>Faith is an Act;</hi> for wee ſpeak not of Faith <hi>in actu primo,</hi> as an habit infuſed, and implanted in us, but <hi>in actu ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> as an Act whereby wee are juſtified, for wee are not juſtified by Faith as an habit, or as a grace inherent in us, but (as I ſaid) by Faith as an Act, as it goeth over to Chriſt; as wee ſee here the Promiſe is not made to the Habit, but to the Act of Faith. <hi>Hee that beleeveth, &amp;c.</hi> That is the firſt, I call it an Act,</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The ſubject perſon, ſo it is ſaid to bee an Act of a regenerate perſon, a man univerſally ſanctified, regenerated and born again; for take Faith which way you pleaſe, for the Act or for the Habit, neither of them are before Regeneration.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The Act of Faith, that is not before the Habit of Faith; a thing muſt bee <hi>in eſſe</hi> before it can bee <hi>in operari,</hi> there muſt bee a Habit of Faith within, before there can bee the exerciſe of Faith without.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And this Habit of Faith is not infuſed before other graces, it being part of our inherent Sanctification, as infidelity is a part of our corruption, nor is it again infuſed alone, but together with the reſt of the graces of Gods Spirit, by which wee are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97371:70"/> So that Faith is an Act of a regenerated ſoul.</p>
                     <p>A man cannot beleeve till his underſtanding bee enlightened, and his will changed, and this is not before Grace.</p>
                     <p>Again, to beleeve is an Act of a living man, not of a ſoul dead in ſin, and therefore the ſoul muſt firſt bee indued with the life of Grace, before it can perform this living action.</p>
                     <p>Indeed we are ſaid to be ſanctified by Faith, and ſo it might ſeem that our Sanctification were a fruit of Faith, an effect of Faith, but wee are not to underſtand this as meant of the firſt work of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which is not acquired or put forth by us, but infuſed by God, together with Faith, as being a part of it: But it is meant of the ſecond or further work of Sanctification, and ſo Faith ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth us, as it lends a hand to help forward, and to perfect our Sanctification; for ſo Faith doth ſtrengthen and increaſe Grace in us, by drawing down ſtrength and life from Chriſt daily; and in this ſenſe, as to their <hi>bene</hi> or <hi>melius eſſe,</hi> all our graces have a kind of dependance upon Faith; as a Mediatory grace (as I may ſay) as <hi>our Mediatour to our Mediatour;</hi> in fetching down influence and ſtrength, for the ſtrengthening and increaſing of grace in us.</p>
                     <p>And therefore by the way, it may bee a good Admonition to you, when you finde any weakneſs in your love, patience, or in any other grace, ſtill to ſtrengthen and increaſe Faith; whereby you may draw down from Chriſt ſtrength to all the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The third thing in the definition expreſſeth what this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall act is, and here wee have 1 The <hi>eſſentiale Antecedens.</hi> 2 The <hi>eſſentiale conſtituens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 The <hi>eſſentiale Antecedens,</hi> eſſentially pre-requiſite to the juſtifying Act, and this is <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>aſſenting,</hi> which two I might ſeparate for the better diſcovery of our adverſaries error, in their implicit Faith, who hold that it is ſufficient for ſome only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve as the Church beleeveth, although they know not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any thing that they beleeve, to maintain which blind Faith, they ſay that Juſtifying Faith may bee without knowledge, nay, that it were better to bee defined by ignorance, than by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>But wee muſt not ſtand to anſwer every thing that commeth in the way, for ſo wee ſhould ſtay long enough at the threſhold.</p>
                     <p>I will therefore joyn theſe two both together, as eſſentially pre-requiſite, whereby wee know and aſſent to our own miſerable eſtate, the freeneſs of God promiſe, and grace which hee hath tendred to the ſoul in Chriſt, both eſſentiall Antecedents to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, of which ſome expound that, <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>every one that ſeeth the Son and beleeveth on him, ſhal have everlaſting life.</hi> Where, by <hi>ſeeing</hi> they ſay is meant <hi>Chriſtum praedicatum videre &amp; agnoſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pro filio Dei,</hi> to ſee and acknowledge Chriſt the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, and indeed this muſt go before; It is <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus ad rem;</hi> though not <hi>gradus in re,</hi> it is a pre-requiſite or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

                        </gap>ng Faith, and yet not the former, but this doth juſtifie; as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, a Vulgar knowledge and aſſent to truth, doth joyn a man no more to God, than the ſight of the Sun doth lift a man to Heaven. Otherwiſe did this hyſtoricall aſſent juſtyfie, then it as well as Juſtification ſhould be proper only to the Elect; ſo Juſtification is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. but ſo is not an hyſtorical aſſent, for that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had, and other Reprobates may have.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Eſſentiale conſtituens,</hi> or that formal Act whereby wee are juſtified, and that is rowling or reſting our ſelves upon Chriſt, or truſting on him, for they are Synonimaes; expreſſing the ſame thing in diverſe words.</p>
                     <p>And that this is the formal Act of juſtifying Faith, I refer my ſelf and you to what in this kinde was ſaid before. I here only ſay, that that which is imputed for Righteouſneſs, and by which wee are juſtified, that is the true and formall Act of juſtifying Faith.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch a kind of beleeving is imputed for Righteouſneſs, and is that by which wee are juſtified; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>to him who beleeveth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is imputed to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10, 11. <hi>with the heart man beleeveth unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> and in the next verſe, hee Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth that beleeving, by <hi>beleeving on him;</hi> for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>whoſoever beleeveth on him, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>But here ſome may object,</p>
                     <p>Object. 1. <hi>Firſt, there are many who do truſt, and yet are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: many who profeſs that they do this act, but yet live in their ſins, as</hi> Balaam, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore this is not the juſtifying Act.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, That although every one ſay hee truſteth, yet every one doth not truly truſt, for there is a double affiance or truſt. The one is a ſlight and ſuperficial affiance, grounded upon no other foundation than a great apprehenſion, that it is good to bee ſaved by Chriſt, but yet ſo as neither to leave their old courſe, or imbrace a new. The other is a ſetled and grounded affiance, and ſo qualified, as that it is not to bee found in any not truly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, if it bee, I ſhall yield the cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97371:71"/>1. It is a holy Truſt: <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 20. <hi>Build up one another in your holy faith;</hi> not as though holineſs were required as an ingredient into faith, in the act of Juſtification, or giving us our firſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt; but this I mean, by a holy truſt, that it is ſuch a truſt as is accompanied with holineſs in the root, and brings forth works of holineſs in the fruit; ſuch a faith as is accompanied with holineſs in the heart, and declared in the holineſs of our lives: For although it be <hi>fides ſola,</hi> faith alone which juſtifieth, and gives us the firſt intereſt in Chriſt; yet it is not <hi>fides quae ſola &amp; ſolitaria,</hi> it is not a faith which is alone, but ſuch a faith as is accompanied with holineſs in the root, the graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and holineſs in the life.</p>
                     <p>The faith which doth juſtifie us, is not <hi>in formis,</hi> but <hi>formata;</hi> not a dead faith, but animated and quickned with grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, the whole man being ſanctified.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It muſt be an unfeigned Truſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. There is a counterfeit and hypocritical Truſt, ſuch as never comes to God from love, but for ſhelter in a ſtorm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35, 36. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and yet did but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or ſuch a faith it is, that cloſeth not fully with Chriſt in all his Offices. They are content to have him as a Saviour, but not for a Lord; the priviledges and dignities that come in by Chriſt, they are willing to own, but not the duties and ſervices which he requires. They will commit themſelves to Chriſt to ſave; when in trouble, then, <hi>Lord help;</hi> but to the Devil to ſerve, <hi>Who is Lord over us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas now a true faith, is as careful to do its ſervices, as to partake of its priviledges; if it throw it ſelf into the arms of Chriſt, to ſave it; it will throw it ſelf at the feet of Chriſt, to ſerve him, as <hi>Paul, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It muſt be ſuch a Truſt, as ariſeth from a believing diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within: There muſt be a ſeed and habit of faith, before there can be an act of faith: Although the acts be diſcerned before the habits, yet there muſt be a habit, a believing diſpoſition within, before we can act. I know there are many, who in caſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, lying upon their death bed, or ſome preſent wrack and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, will make ſhew of doing this act of faith; but yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this believing diſpoſition within, like <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd, or the untimely fruit of a woman, or the ſtony ground-ſeed, having no root, ſoon withers, decays, and cometh to nothing. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth not the act of faith, if it ariſe not from a believing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition within; but God hath ſometimes accepted of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving diſpoſition and deſires of faith, when there hath not been ſtrength enough to erect any vigorous act of believing: <hi>I believe, help my unbelief.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It muſt be a perfect Truſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Truſt perfectly in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97371:72"/> the grace revealed. Perfect,</hi> I ſay, not in reſpect of the meaſures and degrees of Truſt, there is none ſuch here: But yet perfect in reſpect of the nature of it; <hi>i. e.</hi> there muſt be a full carrying of the ſoul over to Chriſt, and a full rowling and reſting on him. It cannot be meant of the perfection of degrees, for there can be no ſuch abſolute perfection, to which another degree may not be added; there is none ſo perfect in faith, but that he may be more perfect; none ſo ſtrong, but that he may be ſtronger; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we cannot be more juſtified to day, than we were yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in the ſight of God. For we ſay, that <hi>Gratia remittens</hi> or <hi>justificans,</hi> the juſtifying grace of God admits of no degrees, is not capable of <hi>magis &amp; minus.</hi> Yet the aſſurance of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is, a man may be more aſſured of his Juſtification to day, than he was yeſterday.</p>
                     <p>As juſtifying faith doth imply imperfection in the ſubject, ſo the faith it ſelf, whereby we are juſtified is imperfect, whilſt we are here, in reſpect of degrees.</p>
                     <p>But in the nature of it, it muſt be ſo perfect, that it carrieth the ſoul over wholly to Chriſt alone, reſting and rowling on him; for an imperfect truſt in this kinde, is as good as nothing. He that doth not reſt the full weight and ſtreſs of his ſoul on Chriſt, doth nothing for the matter of truſt. It is not every faint ſtirring and moving of the heart, not every incompleat reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſuch a full reſt of the ſoul upon Chriſt, that if he fails us, we are ſunk and undone for ever.</p>
                     <p>As you know a man is ſaid to lean upon a thing, not when he bears up himſelf onely by his own feet, but when he reſts a great part, if not the whole weight of his body, upon ſome thing or perſon elſe, ſo that if it fail, he falleth: ſo thus it is to lean, to reſt upon Chriſt, to commit the whole weight and ſtreſs of our ſouls to him, that if he fail me, I am undone, I am loſt for ever, I ſee I am in a miſerable condition, I ſee he is an all-ſufficient Saviour, I ſee that there is nothing but death in me, I ſee there is life enough in him, and he invites me to come over to him, he intreats, beſeecheth, promiſeth, and therefore I will go over to him, I will caſt my ſelf wholly on him, I will look no other way, therewill I truſt, and if I periſh, I periſh: I will dye in his arms, I will dye believing. This indeed is that great act of faith, which entituleth us to Chriſt, and gives us an intereſt in him; even in the dusk of the morning the ſoul hath an intereſt. And therefore on the contrary, there is no readier way to be miſtaken, and ſo to miſcarry, than to truſt equally to two ſtays, to truſt to Chriſt, and to truſt to our ſelves too. As there is no way whereby a man is likelier to fall, than to truſt equally to two boughs, whereof the one is ſound, and the other rotten; whereof if one break, it is as bad as if both did, the man is ſure to come to the ground; whereas had he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97371:72"/> pitched his whole weight on the ſound one onely, he had been born up. So here, in leaning both on Chriſt and our ſelves; whereas if we commit our ſouls, and all their burdens to Chriſt onely, if we fail, he ſinks with us: We are ſure to be upheld, the Promiſe, Covenant, the Oath of Chriſt, even Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all would ſink, if we fail.</p>
                     <p>If thy truſt be thus qualified, I pronounce thee a juſtified perſon; no ſoul ever miſcarried in a truſting way, it is ſuch an act as doth ingage all the Attributes of God, his Juſtice, Truth, Mercy, Power, and all to do us good.</p>
                     <p>Object. 2. <hi>But I have put forth this act of faith, and yet, alas, I am not juſtified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou ſayeſt thou puts forth this act of faith, and thus qualified, and yet thou ſayeſt thou art not juſtified. How knoweſt thou that? Thou ſayeſt thou art not, becauſe thou doſt not know thou art, I know that will be the next. For thus poor hearts reaſon to their own diſcouragement. I want aſſurance of Juſtification, therefore I am not juſtified; I want that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, and therefore fear my peace is not made with God. Though there be nothing more clear than this, that a man may have peace with God, and yet want the peace of this in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it is poſſible for a man to be juſtified, and yet want aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it within. Affiance, doth juſtifie in the Court of God; Aſſurance juſtifieth in the Court of Conſcience; to be juſtified is one thing, to be aſſured is another.</p>
                     <p>In the object all is ſure, in the ſubject there may be much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty: It is poſſible for a man to put forth the act of faith, yea, and to continue in ſo doing, and yet walk without peace, and apprehenſions of his own ſafety; thy condition may be ſafe in the promiſe to the eye of faith, though not to thy ſelf in the evidence of ſenſe. Thy condition may be ſafe and ſecure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou for the preſent doſt not apprehend thy own ſafety, or the ſecurity of it. It is ſecure in the promiſe, in reſpect of God; though ſtormy and troubled to ſenſe, in reſpect of our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thou muſt not therefore look for a clear day, and that the ſhower be over, as ſoon as thou haſt taken ſhelter; nor for a calm, ſo ſoon as thou haſt caſt anchor: but thou muſt abide under the ſhelter, and ride at anchor, till the ſhower and ſtorm be over, and wait till times of refreſhment ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Godly ſecurity, and apprehenſions of ſafety, do not ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently attend the act of faith at the heels. Thou muſt ſtay the Lords leiſure, and wait till all clouds and ſtorms be blown over, till all doubts and fears ſhall vaniſh, <hi>Pſal</hi> 57.1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Light is ſowen for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart:</hi> but, with the Husbandman, we muſt wait in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till the corn come up, and the crop come in.</p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:97371:73"/>
                     <p>The ſtorm doth not ceaſe, as ſoon as the ſhip-man hath caſt anchor, the winds then may yet blow, and the tempeſt may be as ſtrong, nay, it may be ſtronger than before; but the rock to which thou art faſtned is ſure, or if thy anchor hold, all is ſure. Nothing ſhall hinder ſafety, though ſomething may interrupt thy ſecurity to thine own apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>To truſt is the act of faith, but apprehended ſecurity is the fruit of believing, and therefore cometh not till afterward, it may be ſome moneths, may be ſome years, after long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Nay, it is not an inſeparable fruit of believing, I mean, thy apprehended ſecurity is not: thou maiſt poſſibly never in this life reach the apprehenſions of thy ſecurity, and yet thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſecure. It is ſecure (as I ſaid) in the promiſe, though not to ſenſe, if thou dyeſt whilſt thou rideſt at Anchor, having thrown it out, and faſtned it on Chriſt; yet thou dyeſt in the ſhip, and not in the ſea; thou dyeſt in the Covenant of Peace, and there is ſafety, though the ſtorm in this world may never ceaſe. That which I would commend to thee, is to be much in ſelf-purging, ſelf-humbling, ſelf-examination, truſt much, and ſtedfaſtly to the end. Do as they did in that great ſtorm, when neither Sun nor Stars were ſeen for many days, caſt out anchor, and wiſh for day; nay, caſt out two anchors (that is ſafeſt in a tempeſtuous night) truſt and pray, that God would break into thy ſoul with a calm morning light; and mean while wait, and ſay, <hi>When will the day break, and theſe ſhadows, this darkneſs, this tempest fly away. My ſoul, wait thou onely upon God, for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is from him,</hi> Pſal. 62.5.</p>
                     <p>Object. 3. <hi>But</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>To believe is an act of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is nothing elſe, but an Aſſent to the truth of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</hi> which is expreſſed in Scripture, <hi>By receiving of Chriſt,</hi> John 1.12—<hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God: even to as many as believe in his name.</hi> Where <hi>receiving of Chriſt</hi> (which, ſay they, is <hi>An act of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding aſſenting to this truth, That Chriſt is the Meſsias, and Saviour of the world</hi>) is made all one with <hi>Believing.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11—<hi>By his knowledge</hi> (Notitiâ ſui, <hi>not,</hi> ſuâ:) <hi>By the knowledge of him, ſhall my righteous ſervant justifie many:</hi> which <hi>knowing</hi> is an <hi>act of the underſtanding alſo.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But we ſpeak not of <hi>Faith in general,</hi> but of <hi>juſtifying Faith,</hi> of that <hi>formal act of Faith,</hi> whereby we ſtand <hi>juſtified before God.</hi> And here we ſay, that—<hi>Faith is not an act of the underſtanding onely, but of the will alſo.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore to paſs this, and come to the places alledged: Where the firſt is,</p>
                     <p>1 John 1.12—<hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power, &amp;c.</hi> where, ſay they, by <hi>Receiving,</hi> is meant no more but <hi>An act of the underſtanding, whereby they aſſented to this, That he was the Meſsias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For anſwer to this place, we ſay, That this word <hi>Receiving,</hi> doth not <hi>onely denote the underſtanding,</hi> but <hi>implies the will alſo.</hi> Which will appear by this <hi>one Reaſon,</hi> among many.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Receiving</hi> is to be underſtood, which is oppoſed to the <hi>Jews not receiving</hi> of him. For, having ſaid in <hi>Verſe</hi> 11—<hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</hi> Immediately is added— <hi>But as many as did receive him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God:</hi> So that the matter of Inquiry will be, <hi>How the Jews did not receive him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Was it then onely in this, <hi>Their not aſſenting that he was the Meſsias?</hi> or, <hi>Rejecting him, and Refuſing him for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It could not be the former, <hi>Their non-aſſenting to the truth of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97371:74"/> this; That he was the Meſsias:</hi> Though it was the ground why Sundry did not receive him; yet it was not the ground, why all did not receive him.</p>
                     <p>For we read, There were divers of the Scribes, and Phariſees, and Prieſts, who knew right well, that he was <hi>The Chriſt:</hi> For ſo much do the <hi>Husbandmen</hi> themſelves confeſs, in the Parable, as Chriſt brings them in (<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.38.) ſaying—<hi>This is the Heir, come, let us kill him, and ſeize upon his inheritance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And how could our Saviour juſtly charge them with the <hi>Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> unleſs they had <hi>known him to be the Meſsias?</hi> Mat. 12.32. and wilfully rejected him againſt knowledge and conſcience?</p>
                     <p>And how can any be ſaid, <hi>To make ſhipwrack of Faith,</hi> which yet the Scripture ſaith ſome have done? 1 Tim. 1.19. unleſs you will ſay, <hi>A man made ſhipwrack of that he never had;</hi> except he do hiſtorically believe, as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and others did; who did not feign a Faith in words, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith; but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the <hi>Majeſtie</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> did in a ſort (ſc. <hi>historically) believe and acknowledge Chriſt the Author of Life and Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>And therefore, as their <hi>Non-Receiving of him, was not ſo much an Act of the Underſtanding,</hi> whereby they <hi>Aſſented not to this, That CHRIST was the Meſsiah:</hi> But rather <hi>an Act of the VVill,</hi> whereby they <hi>refuſed him to bee their Saviour.</hi> As you ſee plainly expreſt by <hi>CHRIST,</hi> Luk. 19.14. — <hi>wee will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore, ſeeing this <hi>Act of Receiving of CHRIST, is not an act of the Underſtanding; but an act of the VVill imbracing him, truſting on him:</hi> And that this <hi>Receiving</hi> is <hi>Beleeving,</hi> as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt ſaith.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>To beleeve</hi> is <hi>to truſt.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. No other way, but by vertue of our <hi>Union with Chriſt.</hi> In our ſelves wee were dead Branches, and grew upon a dead ſtock; and there was no help, nor hope for us, till wee were cut off from our own ſtocks: the ſtock of Nature; And were ingrafted into
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97371:78"/> 
                        <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>the Stock of Life.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle. — <hi>Hee that hath the Son hath Life; and hee that hath not the Son, hath not Life.</hi> Hee that is united and ingrafted into <hi>Chriſt, hath Life;</hi> the Life of <hi>Juſtification</hi> here; and ſhall have the Life of <hi>Glorification</hi> hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. — <hi>But hee that hath not the Son</hi> — Hee, who is not united to <hi>Chriſt, hath not Life:</hi> Nor the Life of <hi>Juſtification</hi> here: Nor the Life of <hi>Glorification</hi> hereafter. So that you ſee, there is no <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Juſtification,</hi> except wee bee united to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> who hath all <hi>Life</hi> in him. There's nothing but death in the World, out of him: And there's no way to have <hi>Union with Chriſt,</hi> but by <hi>Faith,</hi> which is one bond of our <hi>Union with Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is <hi>Faith that unites us to Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Members to the Head.</hi> And being <hi>Members of Chriſt, God pardons us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Malefactor had committed treaſon againſt a King, and were adjudged to loſe his hand, or his eye. If hee could now make his Hand, or his eye which hee were to loſe, to become the Hand, or the eye of the Kings Son: Hee ſhould bee ſpared; hee ſhould not loſe them: They were the hands and the eyes of the Kings Son: And the King would ſpare them for his Sons ſake: So here.</p>
                     <p>Wee were guilty of Treaſon; were condemned to death. Now this is the dexterity of Faith, to make our ſelves to bee <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt:</hi> It is <hi>Faith</hi> that doth ingraft us into <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whereas before wee grew upon dead ſtocks: now being ingrafted into the ſtock of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ſtock of Life, wee have Life derived to us.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>Faith</hi> that marries us to <hi>Christ;</hi> and being married to him, hee anſwers all our debts.</p>
                     <p>It is by <hi>Faith</hi> wee put on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> wee are built on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Houſe on its Foundation.</p>

                     <p>Wee read in Scripture of four grounds, wherefore God made choice of this Grace for the Juſtification of a ſinner.</p>

                        <item>1. That Juſtification might bee of Grace,</item>
                        <item>2. That the Promiſe might bee ſure.</item>
                        <item>3. That it might bee to all the ſeed.</item>
                        <item>4. That no man might boaſt.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The three former you ſhall read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. The laſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the firſt. God made choice of this, that wee ſhould have Juſtification by way of beleeving. That it might bee by <hi>Grace.</hi> If it had been by any other way; by reaſon of any thing wrought in us, or by us; If it had been <hi>by Deſert,</hi> not of <hi>Grace; of Wages,</hi> not <hi>of Mercy; of Debt,</hi> not <hi>of Favour: If God had promiſed Juſtification upon any work of ours;</hi> had told us, <hi>wee muſt bring ſo much Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo much Repentance, ſo much brokenneſs of Spirit, ſo much Grace, ſo many Prayers, Almſ-deeds: and then wee ſhould bee juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> It had not then been of <hi>Grace,</hi> not of <hi>Free-Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore God, For the advancement of his Free-Grace and Mercy, that wee might cry out with them in <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.7. — <hi>Grace, Grace.</hi> That wee might ſee, admire, adore, the Riches of his <hi>Grace,</hi> The height, and depth, and breadth and length of his Free-Mercy. Therefore hath God choſe this way for the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſinner.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Promiſe might bee ſure.</hi> If it had been any other way, the Promiſe could not have been ſure.</p>
                     <p>That which makes the Promiſe ſure, is this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is not founded upon any thing in us. If it were, it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97371:79"/> could never bee ſure. If there were any thing beſides the breaſt of God to bee a bottom and foundation for the Promiſe; It could never bee ſure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it is not performed, nor contrived for any thing done by us; but out of his Free-Mercy and Love. If indeed, there had been any thing in us, which ſhould have been the ground of the performance of this Promiſe to us: wee had been loſt long ago.</p>
                     <p>If God had put us upon the condition of Obedience; and had given us <hi>Grace,</hi> as hee did <hi>Adam:</hi> yet the Law is ſtrict, requiring an exact, Perſonal, Univerſal, and conſtant obedience: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very failing would have loſt us, undone us for ever.</p>
                     <p>But now, When our Righteouſneſs is in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> A Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not wrought by us, but wrought by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; And freely given to us upon the alone condition of <hi>Faith.</hi> This makes our condition ſure.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Promiſe might bee to all the ſeed, not to them of the Law only; but to them who were ſtrangers to the Law of God.</p>
                     <p>God had made a promiſe to bee the Father of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of his ſeed.</p>
                     <p>Now this Promiſe could not have belonged unto us, If God had not provided a way, that wee might bee of his ſeed. Now, according to the fleſh, this was impoſſible: <hi>That wee ſhould bee of</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed:</hi> and therefore by conſequence, wee could have had no intereſt in this Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>And therefore God hath made <hi>Faith</hi> to bee that <hi>Grace,</hi> which makes us ſpiritually to bee the <hi>Seed of Abraham;</hi> that ſo the Promiſe might belong to us.</p>
                     <p>If God had made the Law the condition of the Promiſe: Or, if hee had made the Law and Faith together: yet then wee had never come to bee of <hi>Abrahams Seed:</hi> Becauſe wee were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</p>
                     <p>But God having made <hi>Faith the Grace,</hi> which doth make us <hi>the Children of Abraham.</hi> Hence is the Promiſe to us, as to his ſeed: not to that part which is of the Law; but to that part which is of the <hi>Faith of Abraham — who is the Father of all that beleeve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though wee are never ſo far from the Law, and the kindred of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the fleſh, yet God hath provided ſecurity for us, that wee might bee his Children, and bee inheritors in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is, by <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore God choſe <hi>Faith, that the Promiſe might bee to all the Seed,</hi> not to the fleſh only; for then wee ſhould not bee of his ſeed; but to the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth Reaſon is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That no man might boaſt;</hi> That is, <hi>That no man might have cauſe to glory in himſelf,</hi> or <hi>rejoyce in himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:97371:80"/>
                     <p>Now, if it had been by any other way, by any thing done by us; wee ſhould have gloried. And therefore God choſe this way, <hi>that wee might glory alone in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30, 31. — <hi>That no fleſh might glory in his preſence: Christ is made Wiſdome, Righteouſnes, Sanctification and Redemption, that hee that glories, might glory in the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 45.24, 25. — <hi>In mee you ſhall have Righteouſneſs and ſtrength, and in mee you ſhall glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God is exceeding chary of his Glory. As in our <hi>Salvation,</hi> hee aimed at the <hi>manifeſtation of his Glory:</hi> So hee hath had care to bring it about in ſuch a way wherein there may bee the <hi>Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, if God had pitcht it in any other way, than in the way of <hi>Beleeving,</hi> his Glory could not have been preſerved: wee would have been ſharers with God; wee ſhould have divided the ſpoils of Glory with him.</p>
                     <p>And therefore God choſe this, which is</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A mean Grace in it ſelf.</hi> And ſo his Glory ſhall not bee obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but more perſpicuous, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Nay, ſuch a Grace, as doth <hi>throw a man out of himſelf: empties a man of himſelf, and caſts him upon another.</hi> It is ſuch a Grace, as makes the Soul <hi>all in another; nothing in it ſelf: Rich in another, poor in it ſelf; found in another, loſt in it ſelf: Saved by another, damned by it ſelf. — I live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) yet not I, but Christ in mee. I live by the Faith of the Son of God, or Faith in the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20.</p>
                     <p>It is ſuch a Grace as makes a man <hi>ſtand upon anothers bottom: live by anothers life: Rich by anothers riches: cloathed by anothers Apparel: fed by anothers meat. A poor beggarly grace in it ſelf.</hi> And therefore God choſe this.</p>
                     <p>It is ſuch a Grace, as <hi>gives God all the Glory:</hi> As it was ſaid of <hi>Abraham — Hee gave glory to God by beleeving,</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>Hee gave glory to his Truth, to his Power, to his Wiſdome, to his Mercy:</hi> So this Grace in the <hi>Juſtification of a ſinner, it gives God all the glory,</hi> it robs him not of any peece of Glory, it gives him the glory of his Mercy, of his Truth,— <hi>Hee that beleeves, puts to his ſeal, that God is true.</hi> It ſets up God, makes him <hi>Alpha and Omega, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and finiſher of all.</hi> And therefore it being a Grace that honours God above all, therefore God honours it above all other, making it the Inſtrument of Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, my Brethren, if ever you would have pardon from him, give him the glory of his own Free-Grace.</p>
                     <p>Here is the controverſie between God and man, to this day. <hi>God is willing to ſave us, if wee will give him his Glory:</hi> But our proud hearts will not yeeld to that, <hi>That God ſhould bee all in all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every man would willingly bee ſomething in himſelf, ſtand upon his own bottom. God is willing to give us a Righteouſneſs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97371:80"/> wrought out for us: But wee would have a Righteouſneſs of our own making. Wee love the Spiders motto. — <hi>Mihi ſoli debeo.</hi> To owe nothing to any, but to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Wee are too like that proud Papiſt, who ſaid, — Hee would not have Heaven <hi>Gratis,</hi> wee would merit it.</p>
                     <p>God is willing to give us objective worthineſs, worthineſs in another, in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But wee would have ſubjective worthineſs: A worth in our ſelves. But this will not bee allowed. God will have us poor in our ſelves, empty in our ſelves, caſt out of our ſelves, unbottomed of our ſelves. Hee will have us poor, and blind, and naked, before hee will beſtow mercy on us.</p>
                     <p>God will not have us bring our penny to his purchaſe: One dram to this fulneſs; one ſhred to this garment of <hi>Christ.</hi> Hee will have it by <hi>Faith,</hi> that ſo it might bee of <hi>Grace;</hi> that not wee, but hee might have all the Glory.</p>
                     <p>This is one Reaſon I am perſwaded of the enlargement of our troubles of ſpirit, and breakings; Becauſe wee will not let God be <hi>all in all:</hi> wee will not let God <hi>have all the Glory.</hi> Glad we ſhould bee, <hi>to bee ſharers in our own Salvation.</hi> Glad, <hi>to do ſomething.</hi> We would have it <hi>of Debt,</hi> not <hi>of Grace; of Works,</hi> not <hi>of Faith; of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> not <hi>of Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>God would give us Heaven, but wee would deſerve it.</p>
                     <p>God would give us pardon upon beleeving, that ſo wee might not glory in our ſelves; but in him: But wee would have it by way of working. That all, or at leaſt ſomething, might bee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>But you ſee, God hath aimed at the <hi>Magnifying of his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> and therefore hee hath <hi>choſen Faith,</hi> to bee <hi>the Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee ſhould bee Juſtified.</hi> And if ever you would bee juſtified, if ever you would have <hi>Glory, give him Glory.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. The fourth thing at firſt propounded to bee cleared, was, <hi>How Faith juſtifieth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the clearer anſwer whereto, wee will lay down theſe two Diſtinctions.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 Or inſtrumentally, as that whereby wee receive <hi>Chriſt.</hi> In the firſt ſenſe it hath nothing to do with Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſt, becauſe wee deny Faith to juſtifie in reſpect of its own worthineſs, ſay that we make it <hi>titulum ſine re,</hi> as it were a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of nothing, whereas in reſpect of Juſtification, wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it the only inſtrument, and that is much to bee ſaid of it.</p>

                     <p>In the former ſenſe again it hath nothing to do with Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the ſecond ſenſe as it is related to Chriſt, and brings us over to Chriſt, ſo it is ſaid to juſtifie us, becauſe it brings us to him, by whom wee are juſtified, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39. By him (ſpeaking of Chriſt) all that beleeve are juſtified; by him, but not by Faith abſolutely, but only as relating to him.</p>
                     <p>Indeed wee are ſaid to live by Faith, as well as by Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. to have remiſſion of ſins by Faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. as well as by Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. to bee juſtified by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. as well as by Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. to have peace with God by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. as well as by Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. to bee ſanctified by Faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. as well as by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. to overcome the World by Faith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4, 5. as well as by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.33.</p>
                     <p>To bee the Sons of God by Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. as well as by Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. to have eternal life, and to bee ſaved by Faith, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. as well as by Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. <hi>John</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11.</p>
                     <p>But now you muſt conſider that none of theſe are ſpoken of Faith abſolutely conſidered, as either an Habit or Act of ours, but only relatively, as Faith brings us to Chriſt, and makes us one with him, by whom alone wee are juſtified, adopted, ſanctified, &amp;c. for between Chriſt and Faith there is ſuch a Relation, that as Juſtifying Faith is called the Faith of Chriſt, or Faith in Chriſt, or Faith in his blood, ſo again the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by which wee are juſtified, is called the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</p>
                     <p>And ſo wee conclude this point, that Faith doth not juſtifie as abſolutely conſidered in it ſelf, but relatively, as it hath relation to Chriſt the object, and as it brings the ſoul over to him, makes us one with him, by whom wee are juſtified, have remiſſion of ſins, ſalvation, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. By procuring a ſufficient Pay-maſter; <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Gods Juſtice to the full; anſwered all Bills, Bonds; paid
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97371:81"/> our debt to the utmoſt farthing. Hence, <hi>John</hi> 16.10. — I <hi>will ſend the Spirit, and hee ſhall convince the World of Righteouſneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I go to my Father, and you ſhall ſee mee no more;</hi> — That is; hee <hi>ſhall convince the World,</hi> That <hi>Perfect Righteouſneſs</hi> is wrought for them. That Gods <hi>Juſtice</hi> is compleatly ſatisfied. But how ſhall wee know that? Becauſe — <hi>I go to my Father, and you ſhall ſee mee no more.</hi> — That is, you ſhall ſee mee no more <hi>in this kind,</hi> you ſhall ſee mee no more <hi>to come to ſuffer,</hi> or <hi>ſatisfy for ſin;</hi> for I have done that already, I have compleatly ſatisfied Gods Juſtice for ſin. And therefore you ſhall ſee mee no more in this kind.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, If Juſtice had not been compleatly ſatisfied: If there had been but one ſin upon the file unſatisfied for, wee ſhould have ſeen him again. Heaven could not have held him. But now ſeeing hee is gone, and wee ſee him no more <hi>an humbled, a ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Saviour;</hi> this ſhews all is done.</p>
                     <p>To this I might adde, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. — <hi>Hee hath blotted out the hand writing of Ordinances, that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and hath taken it out of the way, and nailed it to his Croſs.</hi> — where, by <hi>hand-writing of Ordinances,</hi> is not meant the Ceremonial-Law only; but whatever did binde us over to the Curſe: whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did binde us over to death. — All which Chriſt hath removed by his death.</p>
                     <p>And the Apoſtles <hi>Gradation</hi> is obſervable here. In the 13th. verſe hee had ſet down, that our ſins were forgiven. — Yea, but that is not enough, may ſome ſay. Though the debt bee diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yet the writing is to ſhew. — No, ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>The Hand-writing of Ordinances is blotted out.</hi> — But, may ſome ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; it is not ſo blotted out, ſo defaced, but it may bee read, and put in ſuit again; a new quarrel may ariſe. No, ſaith the Apoſtle, — It is taken away. Oh! But (you will ſay) it is not ſo taken away, but as it is laid aſide for a time: it may be produced hereafter. No, ſaith the Apoſtle, there is no fear of that—it is <hi>nailed to the Croſs;</hi> it is torn in peeces, it ſhall never be ſeen again; never ſhall a new quarrel ariſe for the ſame. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not only paid the debt, but canceld, and torn in peeces whatever might witneſs or teſtifie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt us.</p>
                     <p>If a Debtor did know his Debt were anſwered; yet if hee have his Bonds and Bills uncall'd in; hee is ſtill in fear: But, when hee hath all things which acknowledged his debt, croſſed, torn in peeces, made utterly void; then hee is ſafe, hee knows there is a diſcharge.</p>
                     <p>Why <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not only diſcharge our debt, but defaced and aboliſhed all ſuch things, as made acknowledgement of our debt; hee left nothing, that might witneſs againſt us untaken away.</p>
                     <p>And this is the firſt way whereby Faith doth clear us; <hi>viz.</hi> by producing, and bringing forth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who hath cleared all, who is called a Suerty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. Not only in paſſing his word for us; but paying the Debt for us, anſwering all, and cancelling all, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97371:82"/> was againſt us. But Faith doth not clear us only by producing of a ſufficient Pay-maſter, but</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>By making us one with Chriſt,</hi> by which this payment is ours; is all for us. So that wee may ſay with <hi>Ambroſe — Pro me natus, pro me vixit, pro me mortuus.</hi> Faith will ſay, hee was <hi>born for mee;</hi> hee <hi>lived for mee;</hi> hee <hi>dyed for mee: for mee hee fulfilled all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> ſatisfying both Gods <hi>Commanding,</hi> and his <hi>Condemning Juſtice; doing my ſervices, bearing my ſcourges.</hi> Hence hee is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Jehovah Tſidkenu. The Lord our Righteouſneſs:</hi> by Faith having communion with this Righteouſneſs, as if it were <hi>our own;</hi> a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs wrought by <hi>us.</hi> Hence <hi>Job</hi> 33.26 — <hi>God ſhall render to man his Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which is called <hi>ours</hi> by Faith, and is as much <hi>ours</hi> to juſtifie and ſave <hi>us,</hi> as <hi>His,</hi> to <hi>glorifie him.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. — <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt;</hi> that is, to ſuch as are <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers:</hi> for they are all one. And why <hi>no condemnation?</hi> They are ſinners as well as others. It's true, they are. And therefore the Apoſtle doth not ſay — <hi>There is nothing worthy of condemnation</hi> in them: But — <hi>There is no condemnation:</hi> Becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath taken away the <hi>guilt, and condemning power of ſin;</hi> hee hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all our debts, canceld all Books, ſatisfied for all our ſins, which did binde us over to <hi>condemnation,</hi> and <hi>wrath of God.</hi> So that wee may ſay, — <hi>There is no condemnation to ſuch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Law, it cannot condemn us; becauſe wee appeal from the law to the Goſpel, from the Court of Juſtice, to the Court of Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the Law hath nothing to do with us.</p>
                     <p>And, as for the Goſpel, that cannot condemn us; becauſe wee are Beleevers. The Goſpel doth not require what ſinners wee have been, what ſins wee are guilty of: but whether the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler do beleeve; whether wee bee Beleevers or no, which being once cleared, wee are juſtified.</p>
                     <p>You ſee this in the poor Publican. Hee was dragged forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court of Juſtice, and was there caſt: Yet the ſentence took no hold of him, becauſe of his appeal to the Throne of Grace, the Court of Mercy, where by Faith pleading nothing but Gods Mercy, and his own miſery — <hi>God bee merciful to mee a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> hee went away juſtified, ſaith the Text, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14.</p>
                     <p>And this is the firſt <hi>Royalty of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is an <hi>Heart-clearing-Grace,</hi> which it doth, by producing one, who hath cleared all, and by making us one with him, in all hee hath done, giving us an intereſt in all.</p>

Lord, performe thy Promiſe to thy Servant, in which thou madeſt mee put my truſt.

                     <p>Thus you ſee; as God, ſo <hi>Faith</hi> ruling by God, from God, doth not only authoritatively impoſe commands, and lay duties upon the ſoul, but mercifully and friendly helps and inables the ſoul to do what is commanded.</p>

                     <p>It is a Grace thay layes all the tumults in the Soul: all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections in the Soul.<note place="margin">Fourth Royalty of Faith.

When Paſſions of Fear are up, Faith laies them; will not ſuffer unruly fears to come into the Throne, to command the Soul.</p>
                     <p>When Paſſions of Anger are up, <hi>Faith</hi> doth quench their heat: when Grief ſtirs, <hi>Faith</hi> doth bridle and moderate this: when Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content is up, and the Soul is ready to murmur and quarrel againſt God, and his dealings; <hi>Faith</hi> doth lay all theſe riſings. <hi>Faith</hi> hath a ſpecial art to ſtill the Soul, to ſtrike it dumb in theſe caſes. Hence you ſee <hi>David. — I was dumb, and opened not my mouth,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97371:84"/> becauſe it was thy doing.</hi> — Faith <hi>ſtruck him dumb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee read indeed <hi>Zacharie</hi> was dumb; but Infidelity ſtruck him dumb. — <hi>David</hi> ſaith here — hee was dumb, but <hi>Faith</hi> ſtruck him dumb. The former was a Penal-dumbneſs: God ſilenced his Tongue, becauſe hee ſuſpended his Faith: But this latter was a dutiful-Dumbneſs; ſuch a Dumbneſs as Faith hath cauſed in the Soul; which ſhut up his lips, from murmuring, not from praying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. hee praies there, — <hi>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth;</hi> and yet — <hi>Take thy Plague from mee, I am conſumed by the ſtroke of thy hand, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like power of Faith you ſee in the caſe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> when it ſilenced his Soul, in ſuch a ſad condition, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3, 4. — <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto him, This is that, the Lord ſaid, &amp;c. And</hi> Aaron <hi>held his peace.</hi> Why, what was his tryal? why it was the loſs of his Sons, the loſs of his Eldeſt Sons, when they were young, and without poſterity; in the firſt day of their Miniſtration; in the ſight of all the Congregation, and by ſo fearful a Judgement, as fire from the Lord; and in the act of their ſin, offering ſtrange fire: Nay, and which (ſome think) was joyned with Drunkenneſs too: whereupon immediatly follows the prohibition of Wine. So that the Congregation might ſuſpect, they went but from fire to fire; from a deſtruction by fire, to a preſervation in fire; from a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, to an eternal burning.</p>
                     <p>Yet now in all this mark the Power of Faith. <hi>Moſes</hi> having declared the Author God; the cauſe, their ſin: It's ſaid, <hi>Aaron was dumb, and held his peace: Auditâ voluntate Dei ſilet:</hi> having heard the Will of God, hee was mute and ſilent; his Tongue was chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up, hereby confeſſing, ſaith <hi>Calvin, Juſto Dei Judicio extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos eſſe:</hi> That they were ſlain by the Juſt Judgement of God.</p>
                     <p>The like you ſee in <hi>Eli,</hi> when <hi>Samuel</hi> had declared what God had ſaid to him concerning the deſtruction of his houſe: why, ſaith he, — <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what pleaſeth him,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18.</p>
                     <p>And remarkable was that in <hi>Job.</hi> — You may read in the firſt Chapter, how one wave came upon the neck of another.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Sabeans</hi> fell upon his Oxen, and his Aſſes, and ſlew his Servants.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another comes and tells him, — <hi>Fire from Heaven had burnt up his Sheep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third tells him, — <hi>The Caldeans had taken away his Camels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. A fourth hee comes and tells him, — <hi>His Sons and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were eating and drinking, and a wind blew down the houſe on their heads; and buried them all in one grave.</hi> His whole ſtock was loſt in one day. Nay, Hee loſt not his ſtock of Cattel only, but of his Children alſo.</p>
                     <p>My Brethren theſe were great trials, enough to put a man out of patience; enough to make the moſt compoſed man beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97371:85"/> To loſe his goods, his Cattel, his Subſtance, and all in a day: Nay, to loſe his Sons and his Daughters, which were his whole Poſterity, the ſtay and hope of his Family: yea and all at once, at one clap: and that ſo ſuddenly; yea, and in the midſt of their merriments.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were great Tryals: where Yeſterday it might have been ſaid, who ſo rich as <hi>Job?</hi> now to day, who ſo poor as <hi>Job?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet mark here now the Power of Faith; how it ſilenced the Soul. <hi>In ſtead of murmuring, hee fell down, and worſhiped and ſaid,</hi> 
                        <q>The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away. Bleſſed bee the Name of the Lord.</q> Thus you ſee the Power of Faith.</p>
                     <p>And, my Brethren, you had need of Faith. As the Apoſtle ſaid of Patience: So I of Faith: — <hi>You have need of Faith.</hi> As you walk in the way of this life, you ſhall meet with ſuch things as will move you, as will put you beſides your ſelves: If Faith do not ſettle and compoſe you; you cannot bee <hi>undi<expan>

                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> ſurſùm</hi> (like a Dye) light upon your ſquare: if Faith bee not your bottom.</p>
                     <p>You may have croſſes and loſſes before you die. You may loſe your Husbands, your Wives, your Children, your Goods. <hi>Jobs</hi> lot may befall you.</p>
                     <p>And every one of theſe may cauſe a man to riſe up againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, may cauſe an uproar in the Soul. Wee are not Stoicks, wee are not without Paſſions, nor ſinfull-Paſſions, mutinous-Affections: And therefore wee had need of ſomething in the Soul to ſway and keep down theſe unruly diſtempers. And this is only Faith which can ſtil, and calm the ſoul in all ſtorms, and tempeſts.</p>
                     <p>A man without Faith in ſuch a caſe as this, is like a naked man in a ſtorm; like an unarmed man in a battel; like a Ship unballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and unanchored in a Tempeſt. A man without Faith is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no command. Paſſions of Anger, Fear, Grief, and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him. And Paſſion without Faith is violent, breaks down all banks, drowns, overwhelms, and deſtroies the Soul. And therefore you had need of ſomething to ballance the Soul, to charge the Soul, to calm and ſtill the Soul, in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Now you ſee <hi>Faith is an Heart-calming, an Heart-quieting, and ſtilling-Grace;</hi> which it doth after this manner.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Imperiouſly checking the the ſoul. — You do not well to bee angry. You do not well to grieve. You do not well to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, to bee impatient. You offend God, cauſe him to ſcourge you more, to lay more load upon you; ſeeing you bear this ſo impatiently.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> doth ſometimes calm the Soul, in a Mild, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive-way; wherein it reaſons with the Soul — <hi>Why art thou ſo much caſt down, oh, my Soul! Why art thou ſo troubled! ſo diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within mee!</hi> In which reaſoning, <hi>Faith</hi> will take an Argument of Patience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the Author of Afflictions. That is God. Afflictions, troubles ariſe not out of the duſt, but from God, which was the ground of <hi>Davids</hi> patience. — <hi>I was dumb, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe it was thy doing. So of <hi>Jobs, — The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away.</hi> So in caſe of <hi>Shimei</hi> his curſing <hi>David.

It may bee God hath bid him go forth, and curſe</hi> David.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sometimes from the ground of Gods dealings; and that is ſin. <hi>Faith</hi> produceth ſin to bee the cauſe. For this cauſe; and this ſtops the mouth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>That thou mayeſt bee juſt when thou judgest.</hi> This laies a Soul in the duſt; makes a man <hi>accept of the puniſhment of his iniquity.</hi> As you have the phraſe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41. That is, lye down, juſtifie God, clear God in all his dealings: bee ſo far from murmuring, that the Soul will take Gods part in all; clearing God, and condemning it ſelf.</p>

                        <q>
                           <hi>Thus you ſee the Church</hi> — Wherefore doth a living man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? A man for the puniſhment of his ſin? — it is his mercy that wee are not conſumed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Faith</hi> brings to remembrance our ſins. Such a time: ſuch a place, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It laies the finger on the ſore place, diſcovers the cauſe, which cauſes a man to make himſelf the ſubject of Gods anger: and turns a mans anger againſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>This was ſome ground of <hi>Davids</hi> patience; when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed. — <hi>Go up thou Bloody man.</hi> — It made him ſmel his

                     <p n="3">3. Sometimes from the end of Gods dealings.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In general. And that is for good; though it be not <hi>bonum,</hi> yet it is <hi>in bonum:</hi> Though it bee not good, yet it is for good. It is a Chaſtiſing-mercy: not in vindictive-Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>There is a <hi>Miſericordia-puniens:</hi> and there is a <hi>Juſtitia-parcens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> A puniſhing-Mercy, and a ſparing-Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>As God doth exerciſe his Sparing-Juſtice towards the wicked, when hee ſuffers them to go on in ſin; and doth not puniſh them, as wee read, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4 14. — I <hi>will not puniſh your Daughters when they commit Whoredome; nor your Spouſes, when they commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi> the like, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.42. — <hi>I will cauſe my fury towards thee to reſt, and I will bee quiet, and will bee no more angry.</hi> Upon which one ſaith, — <hi>Solo auditu tremiſco;</hi> I tremble at the very hearing. For, if God will correct no more, then hee will deſtroy next. This is a Sparing-Juſtice. And, as God doth exerciſe this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the wicked: ſo hee exerciſeth a puniſhing-mercy toward the good. Hence the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. — <hi>Wee are chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Lord, that wee might not bee condemned with the World.</hi>— That wee may not bee <hi>condemned with the World,</hi> Hee ſuffers the World to condemn us. That wee may not love the World; hee ſuffers the World to hate us. That wee may bee crucified to the World; hee ſuffers the World to crucifie us. Therefore wee meet with Crcroſſes, with abuſes in the World, becauſe hee will not have us periſh with the World.</p>
                     <p>God takes liberty to chaſtiſe our carkaſſes, to heal our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: to afflict our bodies, to ſave our ſouls. And wee have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes occaſion to bleſs God more for croſſes, than for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
                     <p>As there is a curſe hid in the beſt things to the wicked: ſo there is a bleſſing hid in the worſt things to the Godly. There is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in ſickneſs, a bleſſing in croſſes, in loſſes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Hence,— <hi>All his wayes are wayes of mercy.</hi> His <hi>correcting, and comforting wayes:</hi> His <hi>ſcourging and ſolacing wayes.</hi> The wayes of health, and the wayes of ſickneſs; wayes of proſperity, and wayes of adverſity. All are in Mercy — <hi>All things ſhall work together for good unto them that love God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus in the general, <hi>Faith</hi> doth clear to the ſoul, whereby it doth poſſeſs the Soul with patience under any evil, and laies the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and quarrels of the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In particular, Faith diſcovers at what end God aims.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It may bee the trial and exerciſe of our Graces; as in <hi>Job.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that <hi>he humbled himſelf, put on ſackcloath, and went ſoftly.</hi> And this was the fruit and effect of his Legal-Faith, whereby hee beleeved the truth, and certainty of Gods Judgements denounced againſt him, and his houſe.

And it follows, as an effect of this <hi>Faith — They humbled themſelves, and proclaimed a faſt, and put on Sack-cloath, and ſate in aſhes, from the King upon the Throne, to the meaneſt of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And my Brethren, <hi>Faith</hi> hath a great influence into the work of ſelf-humbling.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It takes up ſelf-humbling Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>From God, the juſtice of God, the threatnings, the curſes God hath denounced againſt ſin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> doth Realize all this to the Soul, which God hath ſaid againſt ſin. <hi>Faith</hi> doth not make theſe things more reall, then they are: but doth Realize things to the Soul, not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but real things, which, being lookt upon as reall things, do humble.</p>
                     <p>This is the Reaſon, why one, when he hears of Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings denounced againſt Sin; goes home, and lyes in the duſt; is humbled, and caſt down; as <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when hee read the book of the Law. And another ſtands up, out-faceth Hell, and the curſe; He is never humbled; nor caſt down. It is becauſe the one he looks upon theſe things are reall; and true: the other hee looks upon them, as fancies, Imaginary things.</p>
                     <p>If men beleeved, that all that evil, which God hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt Sin, were true, they could not drink down ſinne as water, nor eat the bread of Sin, with ſuch delight, as they do.</p>
                     <p>If the ſwearer did beleeve, there were a flying Rol gone out againſt him, as <hi>Zachary</hi> ſaith. <hi>If the Drunkard did ſee death in the Pot, &amp;c.</hi> If I ſay, wicked men beleeved the Reality and Truth of theſe things; they could not go on ſo quietly in their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97371:88"/> wicked courſes: but would be humbled.</p>
                     <p>Hence the Apoſtle ſets this down for the ground, why the Preaching of the word was not profitable to them. — <hi>Becauſe it was not mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> They did not beleeve what they heard: and ſo neither the word of Terror, nor the word of Comfort did profit them.</p>
                     <p>As the promiſes of God are not quickning, raiſing, comforting, except there bee <hi>Faith:</hi> ſo the Threats are not Killing, humbling, working, if <hi>Faith</hi> be not there.</p>
                     <p>Wee may preach, till our ſpirits fail, and ſpend our labour in vain, our ſtrength and pains for nought, if the things which God ſpeaks, and we preach, be not beleeved.</p>
                     <p>If you by unbelief, do ſlight all the threats of God denounced againſt ſin, if you make childs play of them, as the word ſignifies, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                     <p>If you look upon theſe but as Bug-bears, things to keep men in awe, and not real things: No marvel if you bee not Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
                     <p>But, if by <hi>Faith</hi> you would Realize theſe things to your ſelves, and behold them not as Fancies, and ſad dreams, but ſuch things as are infallibly true, real things, not as painted Hell, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fire, but as reall: you would them finde them to work; Theſe mingled with <hi>Faith,</hi> would lay a man in the duſt. Now this is a property of <hi>Faith,</hi> to Realize the Object, or thing beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and hence comes an influence on the ſoul, to humble and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Faith</hi> doth not only take up humbling Conſiderations, and Realizeth all theſe to the Soul. But <hi>Faith</hi> makes all this preſent. <hi>Faith</hi> doth give a preſent being to all this. Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Faith imbraceth the promiſe.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. — <hi>Faith</hi> kiſſeth the promiſe; gives a preſent being to the promiſe.</p>
                     <p>And as it gives a preſent being to the promiſe, or word of comfort: ſo to the threatning and word of terror. <hi>Faith</hi> diſcovers death and hell, and all at hand for Sin. <hi>Faith</hi> looks upon ſinne, in all it's Doomeſ-day apparrel, and array: ſmels fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in ſin.</p>
                     <p>Whereas unbeleevers, they look on theſe things at the wrong end of the Proſpective, and that makes things neer, ſeem a far off, and that afar off, is not ſeen at all.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Faith</hi> looks upon them through the right end of the proſpective; And there things a far off, are ſeen at hand, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Hence it is called — <hi>The Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> As it was ſaid of <hi>Abraham — Hee ſaw the day of Chriſt, and rejoyced:</hi> and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was dead many hundred of years before Chriſt: yet by vertue of his proſpective, by vertue of his Faith, hee ſaw it, as if it had been preſent, though it were never ſo far off: So here though the ſecond day of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the day of judgement bee a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97371:89"/> far off; yet <hi>Faith</hi> ſees it, and is humbled; <hi>Faith</hi> gives it a preſent Being.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Faith</hi> applies and brings home all this to Soul. As the word of Comfort, the Promiſe is applyed, and brought home to the Soul by <hi>Faith:</hi> ſo the word of Terror, the Threatning is brought home to the ſoul by the ſame <hi>Faith;</hi> by which the Soul is caſt down and humbled.</p>
                     <p>The manner of <hi>Faiths</hi> Application is by a practical Syllogiſme, where the Major, or firſt Propoſition is the Word of God: The Aſſumption, or ſecond Propoſition is the Teſtimony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and the concluſion is inferred from them both, as <hi>hee that beleeveth not, but continueth in ſir,</hi> is for the preſent guilty and obnoxious to wrath, at the laſt Judgement.</p>
                     <p>But I beleeve not, but continue in ſin.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I am for the preſent guilty and obnoxious to wrath, to bee inflicted at the laſt Judgement.</p>

Thus you ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. when God had diſcovered himſelf in his Pardoning-Mercy, his waſhing, Forgiving-Mercy to the beleeving ſoul; then they ſhall mourn and bee humbled.</p>
                     <p>Oh! There is nothing breaks the heart more than Mercy; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing melts a man more than the ſmiles of God, the Mercies of God; which being diſcovered to the Soul, the Soul is not able to ſtand ſtubborn under it.</p>

                     <p>Never ſoul that looked on him by Faith, but came away with another heart. — <hi>They looked to him, and were enlightened,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But plainly you ſhall read the</hi> Transforming Power of Faith, <hi>2 Cor. 3.18.</hi> — <q>Whiles beholding as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord; wee are changed into the ſame image, from Glory to Glory.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such a Glaſs hee is, that never did the Eye of Faith behold him, but the Soul was changed with the ſight, from a Wolf into a Lamb; from a ſinner, into a Saint; from Darkneſs to Light. — <hi>You were once Darkneſs; now are you Light in the Lord.</hi> It turns a man upſide down; wholly transforms him.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, there is no change of the ſubſtance of ſoul and body; nor of the faculties of ſoul and body: but the qualities of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are cleer changed.</p>
                     <p>The Head is transformed; where before was darkneſs, now there's Light: where before it did judge highly of carnal things, and low eſteemed ſpiritual: it doth now the quite contrary.</p>
                     <p>The Will is transformed: where before it was full of obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſtoutneſs, contradiction and rebellion: now there is pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to good. and conformity between Gods Will and his. They are not two, but one Will. Gods Amen, is his Amen: Gods <hi>Fiat.</hi> his <hi>Fiat:</hi> Gods Will, his will.</p>
                     <p>So the Heart, that is transformed; whereas before it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a noiſome ſink of ſin, nothing but a Cage of unclean birds, the womb of ſin, a ſeminary of luſt: Now it is waſhed, purged, purified, ſanctified, made a fit Receptacle for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> an Habitation for God, by his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee <hi>Faith is an Heart-transforming-Grace.</hi> Wee cry and ſay, Oh! If I had another heart I could beleeve. If my heart were more holy, more ſanctified: why the way to get ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart is <hi>to beleeve:</hi> do but <hi>beleeve,</hi> and you ſhall ſee <hi>another heart come into you; another Spirit; another Soul.</hi> Do but look upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and you ſhall bee transformed. It is ſuch a look as ſends a man away with another heart.</p>
                     <p>As the Wiſe men; It is ſaid, — After they had ſeen <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they went home another way: So, when by <hi>Faith</hi> wee have ſeen <hi>Christ,</hi> it ſends the Soul another way, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>There is this Power of <hi>Faith,</hi> to transform the Soul into the nature of the Object beleeved. Belief of the Promiſes breeds Principles in the Heart ſuitable to the Promiſes. Belief in <hi>Chriſt</hi> breeds a Spirit ſuitable to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <hi>Faith,</hi> Belief in God a Father, breeds Principles of Love, Fear, Reverence, and Obedience in the Soul; ſuch things as are agreeable: So the belief in <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Saviour, breeds Principles of Truſt, of Love, of Deſire, with the like.</p>

                     <p>A Beleeving heart is an holy heart: and an holy heart is a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heart.

                     </p>
                     <p>— <hi>There is no Peace, ſaith my God to the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 57.21.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They have no Peace with God: God is their enemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They have no Peace with Conſcience: that is full of ſtorms: as one ſaid of <hi>Jonah, ubi peccatum, ibi procella:</hi> Where ſin is, there is a ſtorm.

                     <p>And, that Peace thou haſt in a ſinfull way, it is a fore-runner
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97371:93"/> of eternal war: it is but like the Peace of the old World — <hi>They ate, they drank, they married, and gave in marriage, till at laſt the flood came, and ſwept them all away,</hi> Luk. 17.27. — It is but the Peace of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the Peace of <hi>Agag,</hi> the Peace of <hi>Joab,</hi> and <hi>Shimei,</hi> the Peace of <hi>Eli's</hi> houſe: the Peace of all ungodly men — <hi>who, when they ſay, Peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction, as travel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a woman with childe; ſo that they ſhall not eſcape, 1 Theſ. 5.3.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. 2. <hi>The ſecond part of the Objection is, Many are Beleevers, who yet want Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeed the beſt have no perfection of Peace; becauſe they want a perfection of Grace. They have no perfection of Peace, becauſe they have not the perfection of Faith, the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Grace.</p>
                     <p>If there were a perfection of Grace, then there might bee a perfection of Peace. But the perfection of both is reſerved to another world.</p>
                     <p>Though ſometimes Beleevers may have ſuch a Peace as may overcome all doubts, fears, troubles, &amp;c. yet ordinarily their Peace is not ſo high. There is doubting as well as confidence; fear as well as Faith; trouble as well as Peace.</p>
                     <p>The Peace of the godly here is a peace joyned with war. Our inward Peace is joyned with inward War, war againſt ſin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. It is ſuch a Peace as doth not conſiſt in freedome from war; but in an actual warring: <hi>The Fleſh ſtill luſting againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh.</hi> And, till this great Make-ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e bee taken away, till ſin bee deſtroyed, wee muſt look for no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſecondly. You ſay; Beleevers want Peace. It may bee they do: They want the ſenſe of Peace, but not the ground of Peace. They have the ground of Peace, intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, Juſtification, pardon of ſin, Sanctification; although for preſent, they want the ſenſe of Peace, the clear ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of all this to their Souls.</p>
                     <p>They have Peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. But they want Peace with themſelves. The direct act of Faith gives a man Peace with God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.5. — <hi>Let him take hold of my ſtrength, and I will bee at Peace with him.</hi> But the Reflect act of Faith is it which gives a man Peace within himſelf. A man may have the one, and yet want the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It may bee they hold ſome ſecret Compliance with ſome ſecret and ſweet corruption. There may bee ſome ſecret <hi>Jonah,</hi> which lies under hatches; ſome ſecret <hi>Achan,</hi> which lies undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; ſome ſecret cloſe corruption, which may cauſe God to make war againſt his own people, and deny them Peace.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, in this caſe wee muſt do as the Marriners in the ſtorm; as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their trouble; caſt lots: enter upon inquiry, what that is, that troubles our Peace; and then caſt him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97371:93"/> that our hearts may bee calmed.</p>
                     <p>Wee have a paſſage worth obſervation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. to 23. <hi>Joab</hi> beſieged <hi>Abel,</hi> and threatned war. A woman cryes out from the City, to know the cauſe. <hi>Hee returns her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> — <q>There was one <hi>Sheba</hi> the ſon of <hi>Bichri,</hi> who was a traitor to the King. Caſt his head over the Wall, and all ſhall bee at Peace; <hi>which done, Joab,</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> retired every man to his tent, and there was a Peace.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus God doth oftentimes beſiege one of his own Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they harbour ſome ſecret Traitor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome cloſe luſt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And therefore it would bee our wiſdome to inquire and finde out the Traitor: to yeeld up our ſins, and God will bee at Peace with us; whereas otherwiſe God will never bee at Peace with him, who is at Peace with his luſts; nor ſpare him, that ſpares his ſin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It may bee they want preſent Peace, becauſe for preſent, they are in warring conditions,

                     <p>The Soul is now in the purſuit of Peace. And, though with <hi>Rebekah,</hi> they have ſome ſtrugling in the womb for a time: yet God will part the womb at laſt — <hi>Hee will ſpeak Peace to his People at laſt:</hi> hee will break the Cloud, and diſcover himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. You ſay; Beleevers want Peace.</p>
                     <p>But it is, not as they are Beleevers, but as they are Doubters, If they had more Faith, they would have more Peace.</p>
                     <p>It may bee they give away to jealous miſ-giving, and miſtruſting thoughts of God, or of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Some there are who do nothing but make objections againſt themſelves, and Gods dealings with them. And a quarrelſome heart is for the moſt part, a troubleſome heart.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall ſee ſome to whom God hath given evidences of their eſtate and condition, and ſuch as might content them, ſuch as they might have Peace in: But they will quarrel againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Either their evidences are not ſo clear as others are; not written in ſo fair and legible characters as others are.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe they want ſealing. And therefore they will take no comfort in them.</p>
                     <p>Thus do many forſake their own mercies, breed their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and are injurious to their own peace. <hi>When God hath ſpoken Peace, and Peace to their Souls: yet they return back again to folly; to the folly of Unbeleeving, Doubting, Queſtioning of Gods love.</hi> And no marvel, <hi>if ſuch do want Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men, that will forgoe their evidences, give up their claim and title to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Men whom Satan can make unſay what they know
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97371:94"/> God hath ſaid to their hearts, may ſoon ſit down in dumb ſilence and diſcouragement.</p>
                     <p>If when God hath manifeſted himſelf to you; hath come and ſupped with you; hath given you the white ſtone of abſolution, the Hidden <hi>Manna</hi> of comfort and conſolation; thoſe manifeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of his love: and yet you will joyn Iſſue with Satan, give way to doubts: No marvel if you diſturb your peace; bring inſufferable fears and diſquiets upon your ſelves. And it were juſt with God, to leave you to the doubts and miſ-givings of your own hearts; and never to give you a word of Peace more: but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to bring your gray hairs with ſorrow to the Grave; ſeeing nothing will ſatisfie you.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Reaſon why Beleevers have no more Peace, is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeek Peace no more in a way of beleeving. They ſeek it more in the Law, than in the Goſpel: more in Sanctification than in Juſtification: more in the Precept than in the Promiſe: more in working, than in beleeving: more in their Obedience than in <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore no marvel, ſeeing all this is imperfect, that they have no more perfection of peace.</p>
                     <p>So long as you make the grounds of your peace any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelves, or any thing wrought by your ſelves; you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have fulneſs of peace.</p>
                     <p>There may bee ſome peace for a time in theſe things: but it is not a full and ſatisfying peace; nor yet a permanent and conſtant peace, It may be gotton to day; loſt, or incumbred to morrow.</p>
                     <p>Every imperfection will diſturb your peace. Every failing will raiſe up a new and freſh ſtorm, breed a new quarrel in the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Hee that would have peace, muſt ſeek it in the God of Peace; in the Prince of Peace, in <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; in whom hee ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. — <hi>Wee ſhould have Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When there's a ſtorm in your ſelves, there's peace in him: when there's no peace in you in regard of your imperfections and failings; there's yet peace in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is a perfect Saviour. The Sacrifice is imperfect, but the Prieſt is perfect.</p>

If it had been an adopted Son only, and not his Natural, or if his Natural, and but one among many, the trial had not been ſo great, But hee was his own, and only Son, and the Son of his old age; and therefore like to have no more; the Son of the promiſe; not an <hi>Iſmael,</hi> but an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Son long expected, now excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly rejoyced in; hee was the Son of his Love. Now to part with ſuch a Son was a great tryal.</p>
                     <p>But here was not all the tryal. If hee had but parted with him in the way of Nature, by a natural death; this had not been ſo much: but to part with him in way of Sacrifice, wherein hee was to bee cut in peeces; nay, and hee himſelf muſt bee the Butcher of this Son of his Love; muſt imbrue his own hands in the blood of this Son. This was a great tryal; yet here was ſeen the power of Faith, tht it inabled him to obey. Hee did not conſult with Fleſh and Blood; did not diſpute, but obey — <hi>By Faith hee obeyed.</hi>

                        <hi>Faith it is an Heart-inabling-Grace.</hi> It will inable you to pray; yea, and to pray to purpoſe, to wreſtle with God. Beleeving-prayers, are wreſtling prayers; wherein the Soul wreſtles with God by ſtrength of his Promiſe; his Covenant, his Truth, his Chriſt.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Towards himſelf. It inables a man to walk through the duties of all relations faithfully. The Husband to the Wife: the Wife to the Husband, The Parents to the Childe; The Child to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; The Maſter to the Servant; The Servant to the Maſter, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Faith is the great Task-Maſter of the Soul. But it is not like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Task-Maſter, to command burdens, and afford no help: To require the Tale of Brick, and give no Straw. This indeed the Law doth. It is an hard Task-Maſter. It commands; but gives no ability.<note place="margin">Jubet; fed non juvat. Efficit quod imperat. Jubet &amp; juvat.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But not ſo Faith. It commands, and laies in ſtrength to do. It gives what it commands; by going over to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and fetching ſtrength from him; whereby the ſoul is inabled to obey what it is commanded.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> That — <hi>His Government ſhall bee upon his ſhoulders:</hi> Not only in his hand having a Scepter only to command, but upon his ſhoulders, wherein there is ſupport to obey com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. So it may bee ſaid of Faith, which governeth from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by <hi>Christ,</hi> Its Government is upon its ſhoulder; inabling the ſoul to do what it commands.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Faith begets <hi>Soul-inabling-Principles;</hi> Principles in the ſoul ſuitable to the things commanded; whereby a man is inabled to obey.</p>
                     <p>All ſtrength for new Obedience ariſeth from a new Nature. And this new Nature is nothing elſe, but that conformity to the Law of God, whereby a man is not only able to obey, but willing to obey: when Principles are wrought in our hearts ſuitable to the Precepts: when there is a Law within us, anſwering to the Law without us: — It will be meat and drink; it will be natural to obey: it is not now hard to pray to clear. — <hi>The yoak is eaſy, the burden is light.</hi> Theſe things are not tasks but delights; not medicines, but meat; not phyſick, but food, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. — <hi>I delight to do thy Will,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> and what was the ground? — <hi>Thy Law is in my heart.</hi> There were Principles agreeable to the Precepts, and that made him not only to obey, but to obey with delight.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith ſupplies a man with <hi>Soul-inabling-Strength,</hi> from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Wee have need not only of preventing, but aſſiſting Grace: not only of operative, but cooperative ſtrength: not only of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but of aſſiſtant, the continual ſuccours, aids and ſupplies of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97371:95"/> the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> And Faith doth ſupply the ſoul with ſtrength from him, — <hi>without whom wee can do nothing, and through whoſe might wee are inabled to do all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Faith laies in ſupplies of ſtrength from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherewith wee are inabled for any ſervice. It calls in for all the ſtrength of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the aids of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby wee are ſtrengthened.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith doth furniſh a man with Soul-inabling-conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From God, the mercies of God, the goodneſs and ſweetneſs of God; All which do incourage and inable the ſoul to obey. A loving Maſter makes a diligent Servant. A mercifull God, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Chriſtian. Nothing doth ſo prevail with the heart as love. — <hi>The Love of Chriſt conſtrains us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When Faith ſhall diſcover to the heart what we were, what we are, what God might, what God hath done with us; it will break out with</hi> David <hi>with a</hi> — <q>Quid Retribuam, &amp;c. What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits! I will take the cup of Salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows, &amp;c.</q> 
                        <hi>Pſal. 116.12.</hi> This overcomes the Soul with Love. That heart that is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the ſweetneſs of mercy, is prepared to overcome any difficulty of ſervice. — <hi>My heart is prepared, my heart is prepared.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the work. Faith furniſhes a man with ſoul-inabling-conſiderations from the excellency of the imployments: hee ſees a peece of Heaven in tem: hee ſees theſe ſervices full of beauty, ſweetneſs, deſireableneſs, No ſervice to the ſervice of the King. Oh! what then is the ſervice of the King of Kings.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From the rewards which God hath promiſed to obedience. And theſe rewards Faith makes uſe of, to quicken and ſtir up the ſoul to Obedience; to bee ſpurs and incentives to us, as they were to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who — <hi>had an eye to the recompence of the Reward;</hi> as they were to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. All which have a mighty influence into the ſoul, to inable and quicken it to Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith inables the Soul to ſuffer. Yea, and to ſuffer the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the greateſt magnitude. You ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. — Through Faith they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were ſlain with the ſword.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It puts the ſoul into a ſuffering frame. It deadens a mans heart to the world, mortifies a man to to the world, and makes a man alive to God.</p>
                     <p>A man dead to the world doth not much care either to leave the world, or any thing in the world: now Faith deadens a mans heart to the World.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Faith puts the Judgement into a right frame. It makes the Judgement lightly to eſteem of earthly, and highly to eſteem of Heavenly things: lightly to eſteem the favours and frowns of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97371:96"/> men, highly to value the favour, and fear the frowns of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith prevails with the Will; to chuſe God above all; and to part with all, the leave all, if they come in competition with God. This Faith doth habitually, in habituall preparations in the work of Grace, when firſt the Will chuſeth with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Thus Faith inables the ſoul to do actually, when ever it is brought to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Faith works upon the Affections, to love God above all, to delight in God, to fear him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A man, who loues any thing, chuſeth any thing, prizeth any thing above God, is a man unfit for ſufferings: hee is not in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering frame. If God and theſe things come in competition, they with <hi>Demas</hi> will forſake God, and cleave to the preſent world. Men, whoſe hearts are too much ingaged to the World; whoſe affections are too much ſet upon the Creature: men, whoſe wills chuſe any thing more than God: whoſe Judgements do prize and eſteem of any thing more than God; to whom God is little, and the world is great: theſe men are unfit for tryals.</p>
                     <p>And therefore this is the firſt way, whereby <hi>Faith doth inable the Soul,</hi> by putting it into a ſuffering frame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith doth furniſh the ſoul with ſuffering Reſolutions. A beleeving heart is a reſolved heart. Nothing cauſeth a ſuſpenſion in the Will more than Unbeleef. Hee that <hi>doubteth is like a wave of the Sea,</hi> ſometimes going this way, and ſometimes carried back again. Whereas Faith doth reſolve the heart, makes the ſoul reſolve as <hi>Peter,</hi> but in a better ſtrength, — <hi>I will dye, rather than deny thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Faith doth cloathe the ſoul with ſuffering reſolutions, to go through a Sea, through a Wilderneſs, through the hotteſt Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, the hardeſt Tryals for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> You ſee it every where in Scripture. In <hi>Michaiah,</hi> in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in the three Children, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the Apoſtles. And to theſe I might adde many more. As that of old <hi>Polycarp;</hi> when hee was perſwaded to deny <hi>Chriſt,</hi> rather than to dye for <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, &amp;c.</note> — <hi>Theſe fourſcore and ſix years I have ſerved Chriſt;</hi> and hee hath never hurt mee all this time, and how then can I blaſpheme my King and Saviour?</p>
                     <p>The like of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who being deſired to conſult with himſelf, before hee ſhould ſuffer,<note place="margin">Fac quod tibi praeceptum eſt.</note> replies. — <hi>Do your office. In ſo juſt a thing as this there needs no Conſultation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like of that rich Virgin which <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeak of; who being condemned to the fire, was offered her life and eſtate, if ſhe would renounce her Faith; ſhee returns <hi>Valeat vita, pereat pecunia, &amp;c. Let my mony periſh, my life cannot:</hi> and though I loſe this life, I ſhall have a more enduring, a more abiding, a more abounding life in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe many more might bee added, to ſhew how Faith doth furniſh the Soul with ſuffering Reſolutions, as that of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:97371:96"/> who ſaid — <hi>if you take away my goods, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Faith begets ſuffering graces, courage, magnanimity, patience, humility, ſelf-denyal, contempt of the World, high prizing of God. It ſets God above all the comforts and contentments in Heaven and Earth, It gives adherence to the Truth; by which the Soul is inabled to undergo any thing.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It laies in ſuffering-ſtrength: ſtrength from God, ſtrength from the Promiſe, which ſaith — <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it ſhall not overflow thee, when thou paſseſt through the fire, it ſhall not kindle upon thee, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 43.2. It fetcheth ſtrength from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who like <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> helps to bear part of every Croſs.</p>
                     <p>Thus Faith goes out of it ſelf; ſtands upon anothers bottome; leans upon anothers power; reſts upon anothers ſtrength, whereby the Soul is inabled to go thorow any thing. All this is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Inſtrument of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It propounds to the Soul ſuffering rewards. <hi>That</hi> — <q>For theſe light afflictions which are but for a moment, wee ſhall receive a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That for the loſs of temporals wee ſhall gain eternals. That — <hi>If wee ſuffer with Chriſt, wee ſhall reign with Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>That</hi> No man ſhall loſe Father or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, or Houſes, or Brethren, or Siſters, for his Names ſake: but hee ſhall receive an hundred fold more, here, and ſhall inherit everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life,</q> 
                        <hi>Matth. 19.29.</hi> God will bee all this to thee. Nay, God will bee more than all this to thee. More than Riches, more than Friends, more than Life it ſelf unto thee.</p>
                     <p>All which conſiderations do exceedingly inable the Soul to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſufferings and tryals.</p>

                        <hi>Eleventh</hi> Royalty. <hi>11.</hi> Faith is an Heart-in-nobling-Grace.</head>
                     <p>That which ſets one man above another:<note place="margin">11. Royalty of Faith. Its a Soul-in-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-Grace.</note> That which doth raiſe up and exalt one man above another, in Gods eſteem, is Faith. that which doth put a difference between man and man, is Faith or nothing, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.9.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Faith is ſuch a Grace as ſets us above others, our Perſons above others. A Grace which makes us Kings, and Prieſts unto God: which raiſes us, and ſets us out of the croud. They are noble, whom God doth in-noble: honourable, whom God doth honour. <hi>God is the King of Kings, the Fountain of all Honour,</hi> who can exalt whom hee pleaſeth, and throw down whom hee pleaſeth: who can in-noble whom hee pleaſeth, and abaſe whom hee will. <hi>And this honour have all his Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This hath God thrown upon the pooreſt Beleever, hee hath
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97371:97"/> made him a King, and a Prieſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith ſets our performances above others. Our prayers, our duties, our obedience. Faith raiſes them above others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. — <hi>By Faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered to God a more excellent Sacrifice than</hi> Cain. <hi>Cain</hi> offered Sacrifice as well as <hi>Abel:</hi> but Faith put the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them. — <hi>By Faith hee offered a more excellent, a more noble Sacrifice than</hi> Cain.</p>
                     <p>Faith puts a difference betwixt the works of Chriſtians, and the works of Heathens. Though there were no difference for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet Faith puts a vaſt difference for the manner.</p>
                     <p>Faith puts a difference betwixt the <hi>Abba-Fathers</hi> of a Childe, of a Saint: and the <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> of a ſuperſtitious Papiſt: betwixt the Prayers of a Saint, and the Devotions of a ſinner: betwixt the cryes of a Saint, and the howlings of an Hypocrite. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                     <p>Faith is an <hi>Heart-in-nobling-Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. It begets in us <hi>Soul-in-nobling-Principles.</hi> Principles like our ſelves. It is ſuch a Grace as doth ſublimate a man, begets high, glorious, and heavenly Principles in the ſoul. By this wee are — <hi>made partakers of the divine nature.</hi> It is an <hi>Heart-ſpiritualizing-Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas Unbeleef doth ſenſuallize a man, beaſts a man, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 5.20.21. Hence wee read, <hi>An Unbeleeving heart</hi> is called <hi>a groſs heart, — make their heart groſs:</hi> ſo Faith doth raiſe up a man, ſpiritualizes a man. <hi>A Beleeving heart</hi> is a <hi>fine heart,</hi> a ſpiritual heart, It refines the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Faith doth raiſe up a man as high above reaſon, as reaſon doth raiſe a man above meer ſenſe. It ſets a man as high above a man, as Reaſon doth a man above a Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>Faith is the Spirit of Grace. Not only a ſpiritual Grace: but the Spirit of all our ſpiritual Graces. It hath nothing but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality in it; and hath to do with nothing but ſpiritual things; with God, with Chriſt, with Heaven, with Juſtification, pardon of ſin. All which are ſpiritual things, far above ſenſe; nay, and Reaſon too: their objects reach not ſo high, which things though they bee Real, and none more Real, yet they are ſpiritually Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, not ſenſually; Real to Faith, not to ſenſe, nor to Reaſon nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore unbeleeving men do eſteem theſe things ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>meer-nothings,</hi> or they are next door to <hi>nothing</hi> in their thoughts; Imaginary things: <hi>Notiones ſecundae:</hi> which have no foundation in Being, no exiſtence in the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith doth implant us into <hi>Soul-in-nobling-Relations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 It makes us <hi>Servants to the great God of Heaven and Earth,</hi> who (though it were Hyperbollically ſaid of <hi>Tyrus Merchants,</hi> yet may it truly bee ſaid of God) <hi>makes all his ſervants Kings.</hi> Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is an honourable, a noble ſervice. Nay, it makes us not only Servants, but</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:97371:97"/>2. It makes us friends of God. <hi>Abraham a Beleever,</hi> was call'd <hi>Gods Friend:</hi> nay, not only <hi>Friends,</hi> but</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It makes us <hi>Sons and Daughters of God.</hi> — Gal. 3.26. — <hi>You are the Children of God by Faith.</hi> Wee may glory in our Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. A Beleever is beſt born, nobly born, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. — <hi>Of his own Will begat hee us, by the Word of Truth,</hi> Joh. 1.13. — <hi>Born of God.</hi> Nay</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It makes us the Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is ſuch as Husband as doth en-noble his Wife. Wee know among men; The Wife is honoured with her Husbands honour. The Lawyers have a ſpeech, — <hi>Mulier fulget Radiis Mariti:</hi> The Wife ſhines with the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Rayes: ſhee ſhines with his brightneſs. If hee bee honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whatever ſhee was before, yet now ſhee cannot bee baſe: If hee bee noble, ſhee cannot bee ignoble, becauſe hee confers and throws all his honours upon his Wife.</p>
                     <p>So here, by Faith, being made the Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt, Chriſt</hi> doth en-noble his Spouſe: <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth adorn, and beautifie his Spouſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.10, 11, 12, 13. — <hi>I cloathed thee with broidred work, and ſhed thee, and covered thee with ſilk. I decked thee with Ornaments, &amp;c.</hi> Wee ſhine with the beams of his Juſtice. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Riches, Graces. — <hi>Chriſt is made to us Wiſdome, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. — <hi>Of his fulneſs wee all have received, and Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. — Nay</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Faith makes us the Members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is ſuch an Head as doth en-noble his Members. <hi>Chriſt</hi> throws more Glory and Honour upon the meaneſt Member of his Body, than all the World is able to make us heirs of. It were better to bee the meaneſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than to have all the Glory of the World, out of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> better to bee the meaneſt twig in this Vine,<note place="margin">Meliùs non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Faith puts us upon Soul-in-nobling imployments.</p>
                     <p>It puts a man upon Prayer, Holy exerciſes, Communion with God; which are noble Imployments, above the World. Faith makes the ſoul live high, above the World, above the Earth. Faith carries the ſoul to Heaven, makes it live were it had its Firſt breath, and being, makes our way to lye above, our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to bee in Heaven, our joyes to bee there, our affections there, our hearts there. — <hi>By Faith</hi> Enoch <hi>walked with God;</hi> hee converſed with God, had to do with God daily, the great God of Heaven and Earth daily in ſupplications and meditations, and holy converſation. All which are noble imployments. The higher the perſon wee have to do withall, the more noble are the imployments.</p>
                     <p>And they are ſuch as do in-noble the Soul. No man hath to do with God in any way, but hee is in-nobled by it. — <hi>Moſes</hi> face ſhone, when hee had been converſing with God. God doth ſhed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97371:98"/> Glory upon all thoſe, who have to do with him. None have to do with a glorious God, but are made glorious. None with an Holy God, but are made holy.

                     <p n="4">4. Faith doth intitle us unto a Soul-in-nobling Inheritance: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, unto Glory. It makes us not only Sons of God, but Heirs. Every Son is an Heir, nay, and a Joint-Heir with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unto that eternal inheritance of Glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1</hi> Joh. <hi>3.2.</hi> — <q>Now wee are the Sons of God: but it doth not yet appear what wee ſhall bee, but wee know when hee ſhall appear, wee ſhall bee like him, for wee ſhall ſee him as hee is. — Then when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, wee ſhall alſo appear with him in Glory,</q> 
                        <hi>Col. 3.4.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee ſhall bee Citizens of Heaven. <hi>Faith doth intitle us to Crowns of Glory.</hi> — <q>To that Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, <hi>2 Cor. 5.1.</hi> To an inheritance, incorruptible. and that fadeth not, reſerved in Heaven for us, <hi>1 Pet. 1.5.</hi> — To a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory, <hi>1 Cor. 4.17.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Inheritance is ſo certain, by Faith to Beleevers, that the Apoſtle ſaith, — <hi>Wee ſit together with him in heavenly places,</hi> Epheſ. 2.6. wee ſit now with him in reſpect of our Union by Faith; and ſhall ſit with him hereafter, in our Communion with his Glory, when wee ſhall bee inveſted with thoſe Royal Robes of Glory.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>Soul-in-nobling-Grace.</hi> It makes God a Father, <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Brother, Angels fellow-ſervants, Heaven our Inheritance. It brings a man into a noble kindred, a noble family, the family of Heaven, and makes all the family of Heaven our kindred. It brings a man unto noble acquaintance; puts a man upon noble imployments; intitles a man unto a noble inheritance: inveſts us with in-nobling Priviledges; and begets us a noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a ſpirit ſuitable to all theſe; ſuitable to our Father, our Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, our Acquaintance, our Imployments, our Inheritance.</p>
                     <p>The whole frame of Chriſtianity turns upon the hinge of Faith. As the Bloud through the veins, ſo Faith runs through every vein of the whole body of Religion. It is the ſtaff of our ſtrength, the ſupport of all our comfort, and the life of our ſoul.</p>
                     <p>In my diſcourſe, of which I have (though indeed the Priviledges of Faith requires an Angel rather than a Man, to make relation of it; yet I ſay, I have) adventured to lay down diverſe Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges of this Grace: wherein all that I have ſaid, or can ſay, falls ſhort of the excellency of it. When I have told you what I can, you may ſay (as the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> when ſhee found the Truth to exceed the Relation) that the one half hath not been told you. <hi>Coelum &amp; Deus:</hi> ſo <hi>Coelum &amp; fides non patiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Hyperbolen.</hi> I cannot here Hyperbolize.

                        <hi>Mountebank;</hi> to ſet down more in the Bill than is in the Phyſick: more in the Relation than is in the Balſome. All I can ſay will fall ſhort of the preciouſneſs of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Yet miſtake mee not; whatever I have ſaid, or ſhall ſay of Faith, I ſpeak not of Faith abſolutely, but of Faith relatively: The Act with its Object. Wee will not make a <hi>Christ</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor raiſe up Faith any higher, than wee may ſet up <hi>Chriſt</hi> with it, by it, above it. Well then, to proceed, wee have laid down di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe glorious Priviledges, or Royalties of Faith: wee have yet more remaining ſuch as theſe.</p>

It ſtarves the fleſh, but fattens the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>It is indeed a ſin-ſtarving-Grace. Faith will not feed and fuel luſt. It will neither entertain nor maintain corruptions. Faith will abridge ſin of that nouriſhment, thoſe dainty bits which it met withall in an unbeleeving heart. It will not lay in proviſion for luſt.</p>
                     <p>Unbeleef is the <hi>Caterer</hi> and the <hi>Provider</hi> for ſin. Sin hath its full deſire in an unbeleeving heart; whatever it luſts after, it ſhall have: nothing ſhall bee wanting to feed luſt.</p>
                     <p>If a man bee addicted to the luſt of uncleanneſs: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the luſt doth deſire, but an unbeleeving heart will make a ſupply of. It ſhall have Books, Ballads, Plaies for the purpoſe. It ſhall have obſcene objects, and pictures to gaze upon. There ſhall bee nothing wanting for the fomenting and cheriſhing of the corruption: nothing ſhall bee denied, that may oile and increaſe the flame of luſt. All a man hath, all his power, all his riches, his eſtate ſhall bee laid out for the fewelling of his corruption; and ſo I might ſhew in other luſts.</p>
                     <p>But now Faith, it ſtarves ſin: it will not hold out the dugg to nouriſh a corruption: It will — <hi>not provide for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof:</hi> It will abridge ſin, and cut it ſhort of thoſe dainty bits, which formerly it had in the ſoul: It will not afford it a thought, a motion, a look, nor any thing that may fewel it, or feed it.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſin-ſtarving-Grace. But though it ſtarve the fleſh, it fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the ſpirit. It is a ſoul-fatning-Grace; which it doth after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Firſt Preparatory way.<note place="margin">1. Per modum removendi.</note> 1. By a Negative way. By deſtroying Soul-conſuming, ſoul-deſtroying, ſoul-pining

                     <p>Men uſe to purge, before they go to fatten. Faith muſt give the ſoul a purge: otherwiſe the ſoul would never thrive; though the paſture bee never ſo good. If there bee corruptions in the ſoul unpurged, the ſoul will never grow and thrive.</p>
                     <p>If a Child do ſecretly feed upon Chalk or Dirt, or ſuch like traſh, it will never grow nor thrive: though the food it eats bee never ſo good and wholeſome meat.</p>
                     <p>So if the Soul do ſecretly feed upon ſome ſecret luſt or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will never grow, never thrive, though the food it feeds upon bee never ſo nouriſhing.</p>
                     <p>And therefore Faith doth purge the heart of luſt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may hinder our ſpiritual growth. Faith cuts off the ſuckers from the Tree, which doth eat out the heart of the root, and hinder the growth of the Tree. Faith takes the Child from the Dugge, which conſumes the Parent. Faith will ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a man from his luſt, and will not ſuffer a corruption to hang upon us, to hinder our ſpiritual growth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith doth put a man into a Soul-fatning-paſture. The whole Word of God is the Paſture for Faith. The Word of God is <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum Adaequatum,</hi> the Even and Adequate object of Faith. There is the only walk of Faith; which, though it bee an incloſed Paſture, a Field incloſed, a Paſture paled in: yet there is enough in it to ſatisfie Faith. Wee ſhall not need to ſtray any whither elſe for want of Paſture; here wee may go in, and go out, and finde Paſture; wee ſhall not need to feed upon ſtubble and ſtraw of humane traditions: here's enough in it to nouriſh us up to eternal life. — <hi>The Scriptures are perfect, and able to make perfect the man of God to every good work,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.

Faith feeds upon Soul-fatning-Dainties: meat which the World knows not of, As <hi>Christ</hi> ſaid, — <hi>I have meat, which you know not of:</hi> So Faith hath meat, which the World knows not of.

                     <p n="1">1. Faith feeds upon Soul-fatning-Promiſes. Indeed the whole Word of God is food for Faith; both the Precept, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: But Faith feeds chiefly upon the Promiſe, whereby it is inabled to walk in the Precept.</p>
                     <p>The whole Word of God is ſincere Milk, whereby wee grow: and the Old and New Teſtament may bee called, The Breaſts of Conſolation; but the New is the better Breaſt. More of Gods heart and love runs in the New, than in the Old. The Children of the Bondwoman ſuck at the Breaſt of the Old, at the Law: But the Children of the Free-woman ſuck here, at this Breaſt, the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Thus Faith, feeds, not only upon the Word: but the choice of the Word, the Promiſes. Yea, and not only the Promiſes, but the choice and freeſt of the Promiſes: the Cream, the ſpirits of Nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>And according to the proportion of Faiths feeding hereon, ſuch is the proportion of ſtrength and nouriſhment conveyed down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul. Hee that feeds ſparingly, is but a ſpare Chriſtian, gets but little ſtrength: Hee that eats liberally is ſtrongly nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>The difference that wee ſee in Chriſtians here; ſome weak, others ſtrong; Some Infants and Babes, others Grown men, ſome thrown down with every blaſt of Temptation, others able to ſtand out all aſſaults: The difference ariſeth hence, that ſome feed more ſparingly, ſome more liberally by Faith upon the Promiſes of Grace: and ſo ſome are ſtronger than others are.</p>
                     <p>If you grow not, 'tis becauſe you feed not: you play with the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97371:100"/> Breaſt, you ſuck not daily. A man may have meat before him, and yet dye, if hee feed not. The beſt feeder here is the beſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Larger the appetite, the ſtronger the Chriſtian. The more the ſoul doth feed upon Promiſe, ſtill the more ſtrength is conveyed to the ſoul, the more the ſoul is nouriſhed.</p>

                        <hi>Chriſt</hi> is food for the Soul — <hi>His Fleſh is meat indeed, and his Blood is Drink indeed.</hi> And hee who feeds upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> moſt, is the moſt living, the moſt growing, the moſt fatning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Christ</hi> is the breeder, and the feeder of ſpiritual life: the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the nouriſher of life in us.

                        <hi>My Brethren;</hi> wee are <hi>all of us naturally, full of our ſelves, full of our ſelves, full of the ſelf of Pride, full of the ſelf of Love, Self-love, full of Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, full of Self-ſufficiency;</hi> wee are apt to think highly to our ſelves.

                     <p>Faith is ſuch a Grace as is <hi>raiſed up, upon the ruines of our ſelves,</hi> not the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> but the <hi>Sin; the ruine of our ſinful ſelves: the ruine of our ſelf of Pride, of Self-confidence, ſelf-ſufficiency;</hi> all which are thrown down, before Faith bee raiſed.</p>

And therefore <hi>Faith empties us of this Opinion,</hi> makes us <hi>poor,</hi> that ſo wee may bee <hi>fit to receive the Goſpel. — The poor receive the Goſpel.

                        <hi>Faith empties the Soul of that Opinion of ſtrength to help it ſelf.</hi> Though a man were convinced, <hi>hee had nothing;</hi> yet if hee have ſuch a conceit as this, <hi>That hee can help himſelf; that hee is able to recover and winde himſelf out of that condition wherein hee is:</hi> hee would <hi>then ſtand upon his own bottom; bee a Buckler to himſelf, and would never come over to Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which kept the Prodigal from his Father, was not the <hi>Opinion of any worthineſs in himſelf;</hi> hee ſaw hee was poor and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to famiſh; but <hi>hee thought hee could recover himſelf, live of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without the help of a Father.</hi> And this conceit kept him off.</p>

                     <p>Men, you know, will rather make uſe of their own gold, than of others; of their own cloaths than of others; of their own friends, than of others; of their own power, than of others.

                     <p>Divines ſet down four invaluable things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The Favour of God in Chriſt.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The Souls of Men.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>The Spirit.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>The Graces of the Spirit.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Favour of God;</hi> That's invaluable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. — <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is better than Life.</hi> And Life is the moſt precious thing a man hath in the World — <hi>Skin for Skin, and all a man hath will hee give for his life.</hi> The Devil was right there. Now <hi>Gods lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſs is better than Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Souls of Men. — What will it profit a man to gain the whole World, and loſe his Soul? Chriſt</hi> ſets the gain of the whole World againſt the loſſe of one Soul. Hee puts one Soul in one Balance, and the whole World in another. And one Soul weighs down all. — <hi>What will it profit?</hi> its too light. All that gain cannot make up this loſs. It is an incomparable loſs, becauſe an irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable loſs; once loſt, loſt for ever. There's no recovery of a loſt ſoul. Though a man may loſe other things, yet may hee recover them again: Man may loſe Riches, &amp;c. but not his Soul, when once loſt for want of beleeving.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third invaluable, is <hi>the Spirit:</hi> not to bee — <hi>bought with ſilver or gold.</hi> Hence <hi>Peter</hi> told <hi>Simon-Magus,</hi> when hee would have bought the <hi>Spirit. — Thy mony periſh with thee. Thinkeſt thou the Gift of God may bee bought with mony?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The Graces of the Spirit.</hi> The leaſt of which doth weigh down all the World. The leaſt grain of Grace, of Love, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, of godly ſorrow, Humility, is worth ten thouſand Worlds. — <hi>Faith is more precious than gold,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter.</hi> Now theſe are the Riches, that Faith doth poſſeſs the Soul of, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Riches of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Other Riches God deals out promiſcuouſly, and—<hi>No man knows either love or hatred, by any thing before him.</hi> A man may do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and proſper, as it was ſaid of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi>

                     <p>But now theſe are ſuch Riches as God beſtows upon none but <hi>Beleevers, — Abraham gave portions to the Sons of the Concubines, and ſent them away:</hi> but <hi>unto</hi> Iſaac <hi>hee gave all hee had.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Other Riches may bee taken away. A man may bee rich to day, and poor to morrow. — <hi>The Lord hath given,</hi>

                        <hi>the Lord hath taken away.</hi> Both with one breath. Hence the wiſe man. — <hi>Riches
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97371:105"/> make themſelves wings, and flye away.</hi> But theſe are abiding Treaſure: A Treaſure, whoſe ſpring is in Heaven; whoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in <hi>Chriſt. — Our life is hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> not only hid for ſecrecy: but hid for ſafety. It is <hi>a ſafe life, an abiding life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, but if they ſhould continue: yet will they do us no good in the day of trouble. They cannot ſave our ſouls from, nor in the day of wrath. They cannot ſave us from ſickneſſe, nor from death; not from Hell. Nor are they able to mitigate our Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to purchaſe one drop of water in that lake of fire. What profit had <hi>Ahab</hi> of his Vineyard? <hi>Baltazar</hi> of his cups? <hi>Dives</hi> of his wealth? <hi>Judas</hi> of his thirty-pence? <hi>Agrippa</hi> of his gay ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel? The rich fool of his full barns? All theſe would do them no good. Neither quench, nor bribe theſe flames; but rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Oile to increaſe them.</p>
                     <p>But now Grace; that riches, which Faith doth inrich us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; it is ſuch as will uphold us in ſickneſs, bee a choice cordial in that bitter potion; it will deliver us in death, ſave us in the day of wrath, and inable us to lift up our heads with joy and boldneſs in the day of Judgement, that terrible day of the Lord, when the wicked ſhall tremble before the Judge, and <hi>call upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall upon them, and the Hills to cover them from the preſence of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Haſt thou other riches, and wanteſt thou Faith? Haſt thou <hi>Mountains of Gold, Rocks of Diamonds, ſhores of Rubies?</hi> And wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou Faith? wanteſt thou Grace? Oh! thou art a poor man.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Faith is an Heart-inriching-Grace.</hi> A Beleever hath title to all.</p>
                     <p>A Beleever is the pooreſt and the richeſt man in the World. As none is poorer than a godly man in himſelf; ſo none is richer than a Beleever in <hi>Chriſt. — Hee is as having nothing, and yet poſſeſsing all things. Chriſt is the Heir of all things. All are yours, if you bee Chriſts.</hi> No ſooner can the ſoul ſay — <hi>Chriſt is mine;</hi> but hee may ſay — <hi>His Blood is mine, his Spirit mine; his Glory mine;</hi> all is mine.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith raiſeth us up from the Death of inward Troubles.</hi> As the ſenſe of <hi>Gods Love,</hi> the apprehenſion of his favour is the life of the Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. — <hi>In his favour is Life.</hi> So the ſenſe of <hi>Gods Diſpleaſure</hi> is the <hi>Death of the Soul,</hi> Pſal. 88.10. <hi>Shall the Dead ariſe to praiſe thee?</hi> Hee ſpeaks of that ſpiritual Deſertion in which hee was, labouring under the ſenſe of Gods wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; which hee calls the <hi>Death of the Soul. — Shall the Dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to praiſe thee?</hi> Shall my Soul, dead and ſunk with diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and apprehenſions of thy wrath; <hi>Shall it ariſe to praiſe thee?</hi> So that this is the <hi>Death</hi> of the Soul.</p>
                     <p>Now, <hi>Faith doth raiſe the Soul up from this Death.</hi> When the Soul ſeems to bee ſunk and buried under the apprehenſions of Gods diſpleaſure, is ſlain with diſcouragements, <hi>lies gaſping and breathing</hi> for comfort. <hi>The leaſt touch of the Promiſe by Faith</hi> doth raiſe up and revive the Soul, and fetches a man to life again.</p>

                     <p>What a <hi>precious thing is Faith?</hi> It is call'd <hi>precious Faith.</hi> And ſo it is indeed; that is able to work ſuch wonders in the Soul, in an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>What a Cordial is this! when a man is in ſwounding, and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-fits, that one taſte of the <hi>Promiſe by Faith,</hi> will fetch him to life again, when the ſoul lies in the duſt, under ſad apprehenſions,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97371:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> heavy Agonies, ſinking and dying; one dram, one grain of <hi>Faith,</hi> will fetch him to life again, ſet him on his feet again, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leaping, and praiſing God. This is <hi>precious Faith</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                     <p>Now, for the manner how <hi>Faith</hi> doth work for the raiſing up of the Soul from under theſe ſpiritual Troubles, wee will only adde theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith doth in this condition look back upon ſoul-raiſing-Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences.</hi> It cauſes a man to conſider <hi>the dayes of old, the years of ancient time;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, in the ſame condition, Pſal. 77.5.</p>
                     <p>It makes a man revive thoſe former experiences of <hi>Gods Love;</hi> thoſe former workings; thoſe fore-paſt evidences; thoſe broken Rings, Pledges, Love-tokens, which have paſſed betwixt God, and the Soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Such a time hee took mee up into his Chariot, and ſpake friendly to mee: Such a time, I ſate down under his ſhadow, and his Banner over mee was love: Such a time hee took mee down into his Winecellar, staied mee with Flaggons:</hi> Such a time hee brake into my ſoul, diſcovered himſelf to mee <hi>a Reconciled God;</hi> gave mee an earneſt of his love, a teſtimony that hee manifeſted himſelf to mee; came and ſupped with mee; gave mee the <hi>White ſtone,</hi> the <hi>Hidden Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the <hi>New Name, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>Act of Faith.</hi> Thus doth it produce the former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences and experiences of Love; and from theſe doth take up arguments to raiſe the Soul, in this dark condition.</p>
                     <p>Why, will <hi>Faith</hi> ſay? Once a Father, and ever a Father. Once a Friend, and never an Enemy. Though wee change, yet God doth not change — <hi>With him there is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of change.</hi> His carriage may alter, his heart cannot. His expreſſion may vary, his Affections cannot. God hath ſpoken Peace, and hee will never unſay what hee hath ſaid. Hee hath given mee ſure evidences, and hee will never take them away again, though hee may withhold the comfort of them. Hee that hath been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, will bee gracious. Men ſhut their hands, becauſe they have opened them: but becauſe hee hath once opened his hands, hee will never ſhut them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith looks upon Soul-raiſing-Promiſes. Such as are not only made for ſupport, but for deliverance.</hi> — <q>I will not contend for ever, nor will I bee alwayes wroth, leaſt the Spirit which I have made ſhould fail before mee, and the Soul which I have created. I was angry with him, I hid my face from him. But I will heal him, I will lead him alſo, and restore comfort to him, and to his mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Iſa. 57.16, 17, 18.</hi> For a moment I have forſaken thee; but with everlaſting kindneſs have I had compaſſion on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa. 54.8, 9, 10, 11. — Zion</hi> ſaid, the Lord hath forſaken mee: My God hath forgotten mee!</q> 
                        <hi>Can a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97371:107"/> forget her child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her womb? Yea they may: but I will never forget thee. Behold, I have Graven thee upon the Palms of my hands: thy ways are ever in my ſight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like promiſes <hi>Faith</hi> looks upon. It doth not ſo much look at the <hi>Face of God; Gods outward carriage and expreſſion in the condition,</hi> as at the <hi>Heart of God, and his inward affection,</hi> which lyes in the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Full well <hi>Faith knows,</hi> The <hi>Ground of Comfort</hi> doth not lye in the <hi>Face of God,</hi> the aſpects of God. If ſo, then our comforts could not bee ſtable. This alters, as wee alter, changeth, as wee change: But the ground of <hi>Faiths comfort</hi> lyes in the <hi>Promiſes:</hi> and thither it hath recourſe, when from <hi>Outward appearance</hi> it can get no comfort.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Senſe</hi> looks upon the face of God onely, upon his <hi>outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:</hi> But <hi>Faith</hi> looks upon the <hi>Heart of God</hi> in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> where it ſees a Calmy heart under a <hi>Stormy countenance; inward Smiles,</hi> though <hi>outward frowns, Inward Affections of Love,</hi> under <hi>Outward expreſſions of diſpleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <hi>Joſeph</hi> had the affections of a brother, under the expreſſions of an Enemy. Hee could put on expreſſions of an enemy; An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry countenance: but yet not put off <hi>Affections of a brother; A loving heart:</hi> ſo is it often with God.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Faith</hi> doth view him in <hi>The Promiſe,</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thither; as you ſee poor <hi>David</hi> had, in the like caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. to the tenth verſe. Hee was in <hi>ſad Conditions,</hi> and nothing could raiſe him. God abſented himſelf from him: Hee fell to <hi>Praying,</hi> to <hi>Complaining:</hi> but yet no comfort came. — <hi>Hee complained and his ſpirit was overwhelmed.</hi> Hee was ſo farre from Eaſe by this, that his Spirit was more oppreſt. Nay — <hi>Hee cald to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance times past.</hi> All this whie comfort came not in. At laſt hee betakes himſelf to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> hath recourſe to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> and then his Soul revived, ver. 10.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Faith</hi> looks upon the firmneſs of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Promiſe,</hi> and is raiſed, revived. Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14, 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. from ſeven to eleven, which are <hi>Soul-raiſing-promiſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>Faith lays hold upon a ſoul-raiſing-Chriſt.</hi> Upon whom whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth lay hold, hee will pull him out of the deepeſt waters. If a man under water have hold of any thing above him, it will pull him out, hee ſhall not ſink. So here, when wee are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in theſe deep waters; if, by <hi>Faith</hi> the Soul lay hold on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it will bear him up, and bring him forth, <hi>John</hi> 12.46. — <hi>I am come a light into the world</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) that whoſoever beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in mee, ſhould not abide in darkneſſe.</hi> The leaſt touch of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> doth raiſe up and revive the Soul in this ſad Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>As the dead man was raiſed to life, and revived, but by <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dead bones of Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.21. ſo the <hi>Dead Soul,</hi> if

                     <p>Thus <hi>Faith</hi> doth raiſe the heart by laying hold of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He, who raiſed up himſelf, will raiſe up all his members. If our head had been ſtill under water, wee had then periſhed: but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen, will raiſe us up alſo being his members.</p>

                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>All Beleevers are not ſo.</hi> They are ſuch as are 1. <hi>Under ſome preſent croſs and affliction.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97371:109"/> ſome preſent evil is upon them; and this may ſadden the ſpirits of the beſt for a time, though this may bee their infirmity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> had learned in all eſtates therein to bee content; and if to bee content, then to rejoyce, unleſs it were <hi>Contentation by force;</hi> ſure not well pleaſing to God.</p>
                     <p>If indeed their comfort did lye in the preſence and injoyment of theſe outward things, then no marvel, if in the abſence of them, they were caſt down. I ſay, If the floods of their comfort were maintained by ſuch ſprings as theſe, then no marvel, if theſe being taken away, they bee bereave of their <hi>Joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſeeing theſe things are too ſhort either to breed, or feed: either to beget, or fuel a Chriſtians <hi>Joy:</hi> why ſhould the deprival of them ſo much affect the heart, as to take away their <hi>Joy?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Have you not ſtill <hi>the ground of Joy?</hi> you have loſt <hi>your goods,</hi> but not <hi>your God.</hi> You are deprived of <hi>your Comforts,</hi> not of <hi>your Chriſt.</hi> And therefore except you do make <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> prize them too highly in your Judgement, ingage your hearts and affections too much to them: why ſhould <hi>your Joy bee taken away?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee <hi>Paul</hi> had learned in all eſtates to bee content, and the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> before mentioned: and why not you?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such they are, as for the preſent are under <hi>ſome ſad and ſore Temptation, combate with Satan,</hi> and for the preſent their ſpirits are <hi>ſadned,</hi> and caſt down.</p>

                     <p>All <hi>Jobs</hi> croſſes did not ſo much affect him as this. The loſs of his Goods, of his Poſſeſſion, of his Children came not ſo neer him, as the apprehenſion of the loſs of his God. Hee could lift up his head under all the other: but here hee was ready to ſink.</p>
                     <p>Such a <hi>Condition</hi> Gods people may bee in, which may cauſe ſadneſs of ſpirit, as was <hi>David, Heman, Hezekiah,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     </p>
                     <p>My Brethren; wee ſhall meet with many exigents in our way to Heaven. And, if <hi>Faith</hi> do not guide, wee are ſure to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs.</p>
                     <p>You ſee what an Exigent <hi>Eſther</hi> was put unto: Either to <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect duty,</hi> or to <hi>endanger her life.</hi> Shee put her life in her hand, for the good of the Church of God. If ſhee had now conſulted with fleſh and blood; if ſhee had followed the guidance of Reaſon, ſhee had been miſ-led.</p>
                     <p>No doubt but ſenſe and Reaſon would have told her, that it had been beſt, not to hazzard her ſelf, and put her life in jeopardy: but conſulting with <hi>Faith,</hi> and following the guidance thereof, ſhe was reſolved to <hi>do the duty,</hi> though ſee <hi>periſhed in the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> And it was her ſafety.</p>
                     <p>The like in <hi>Abraham.</hi> You ſee what an Exigent hee was put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Hee was <hi>to part with his Son, his only Son, the Son of his Love, the Son of his old age; a Son of ſo many Prayers, and ſo many Promiſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No doubt, if hee had conſulted with fleſh and bloud, and carnal reaſon, they would have bid him <hi>to ſpare his Son:</hi> but following the <hi>guidance of Faith,</hi> hee was <hi>willing to ſacrifice his Son,</hi> Heb. 11.17. — <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham, <hi>when hee was tryed, offered up his Son</hi> Iſaac: <hi>of whom it was ſaid, that in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed bee called.

If hee had followed the guidance of Reaſon, or ſenſe, hee had miſcarryed. That would have told him, that hee was to regard himſelf, and his preſent happineſs, and not throw himſelf out of all. But then hee had been miſ-led. But following the guidance of <hi>Faith</hi> hee forſakes all.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>Guidance of Faith</hi> they wanted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Who durſt not confeſſe Chriſti, for fear of being thrown out of the Synagogue.</hi> If they had had <hi>Faith,</hi> it would have guided them to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> bee the Iſſue what it will.</p>
                     <p>The like of the <hi>Young-man.</hi> Hee went far, but when it was put to him, <hi>to leave all, to follow Chriſt; to ſell all:</hi> it is ſaid — <hi>Hee went away ſorrowful.</hi> Hee conſulted with Senſe and Reaſon; hee wanted the <hi>Guidance of Faith,</hi> which would have directed him <hi>to part with all, to caſt away all, rather than to leave Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like of <hi>Balaam.</hi> Either hee muſt <hi>forſake the wages of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, or curſe the People:</hi> but hee had more deſire of mans reward, than hee had <hi>Faith</hi> to expect God, and ſo hee miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed.</p>
                     <p>And, my Brethren, ſuch like ſtraits wee may meet withall in our way to Heaven. And, if wee follow not the <hi>Guidance of Faith,</hi> wee are ſure to bee miſ-led.</p>
                     <p>It hath been the ordinary choice that the Saints have been put to, <hi>Either forſake thy God, or forſake thy Goods: Either leave Chriſt, or leave thy Comforts: Either renounce Chriſt, or loſe thy Friends, thy Father, thy Mother; nay, thy liberty, thy life.</hi> To theſe exigencies and ſtraits Gods people have been driven. And had they not had <hi>Faith,</hi> they had ſurely been miſ-led: but having <hi>Faith,</hi> it guided them to ſuffer loſſe of friends, loſs of goods, loſs of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, loſs of life it ſelf for <hi>Chriſt:</hi> as you ſee up and down, in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles; who accounted not their lives dear to them, for <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it was the uſual ſpeech of the Primitive Martyrs, when they were perſwaded to <hi>leave Chriſt,</hi> rather than to ſuffer.<note place="margin">Parce precot Imperator, tu Carcerem; ille Gehennam.</note> — <hi>Spare good Emperour; thou canſt but cast into priſon: God into Hell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of <hi>Policarp.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like of <hi>Frederick the Elector of</hi> Saxony; who was priſoner to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; and was promiſed inlargement and reſtitution to his former dignity; <hi>If hee would come to Maſs.</hi> It was <hi>Faith guided</hi> him to return this anſwer. — <hi>In earthly things I am ready to yeeld to</hi> Caeſar. <hi>In heavenly, only to Chriſt. And Chriſt is more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to mee in Bonds, than</hi> Caeſars <hi>Court without Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I might run down in particular examples in all ages, and ſhew you how <hi>Faith</hi> hath guided men in theſe ſtraits: which had they followed the direction of Reaſon and Senſe, they had been loſt for ever.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>Faith</hi> which guides the heart, in theſe difficult caſes. It is an <hi>Heart-guiding-Grace.</hi> And this is the way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> doth reject the wiſdome of the fleſh, and goes by Gods light, It ſhuts our eyes, and walks by Gods light. It follows God, as the blinde man follows his Guide, all his dayes. Hee who makes Gods Word all his Reaſon, ſhall have God a Counſellor. <hi>Faith</hi> will not own the wiſdome of the fleſh. — <hi>the carnal minde is enmity
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97371:112"/> to God. It will not bee ſubject.</hi> It is full of contumacy and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt God and his wayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> will neither own the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> nor as a <hi>Counſellor.</hi> As it will not obey the commands of the fleſh, ſo it will not follow the counſels of the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter would not conſult with fleſh and blood, but was obedient to the heavenly viſion:</hi> where is implied, if hee had hearkened to fleſh and bloud, hee had been diſobedient to the heavenly viſion.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Faith makes God its guide,</hi> Pſal. 48.14. — <hi>This God is our God for ever: hee ſhall bee our guide unto death. Faith</hi> ſeeks direction from God, who is <hi>the Counſellor, the God of all wiſdome.</hi> And the Soul, that leans upon God for wiſdome, ſhall not want it. He who truſts in the God of wiſdome ſhall not want direction. I ſay, hee, who ſhuts his own eyes, and ſincerely falls down at the feet of God for counſel, ſhall have direction from him.</p>
                     <p>If indeed, wee ſeek as <hi>Balaam,</hi> with a double heart, or as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. who asked counſel, but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of their way; wee then may miſcarry. But hee who ſeeks with an humble and upright heart, that asks the way to <hi>Sion, with his face thitherward,</hi> reſolved to go, as God directs, <hi>Such will God direct in his way: ſuch hee will guide in all the wayes of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Moon by darting her beams and influence into the Sea, doth move that great body backward and forward; which they ſay, is the cauſe of the ebbings and flowings of the Sea: ſo God doth in difficult caſes, dart ſuch a beam of light into the Soul, ſuch ſtrong influences into the Spirit, as doth carry the ſoul the way it ſhould go.</p>
                     <p>A man may follow his own wiſdome and miſcarry: but hee that ſhuts his eyes and follows God, is ſure not to bee miſ-led. Hee, who rejects the counſel of the fleſh, and is reſolved to walk by the direction of the Spirit, though never ſo unlikely to fleſh and bloud, is ſure to go right.</p>
                     <p>You ſee an example of this in <hi>Balaam;</hi> in <hi>Saul</hi> ſparing of <hi>Agag,</hi> and the beſt of the flock: in ſacrificing before <hi>Samuel</hi> came to him. But I'le name but one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 41.10. to the end of the Chapter. <hi>Johanan,</hi> who was the Captain of the Reſidue of the Jews left in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſired <hi>Jeremy</hi> (though with a double and deceitful heart) to enquire of the Lord, whether hee ſhould go down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> or abide at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> And bound himſelf with a vow, that — <hi>Whatever the Lord ſaid, hee would do it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeremy</hi> comes, and tells him, <hi>hee muſt abide at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and God would preſerve him.</hi> But <hi>Johanan</hi> wanted <hi>Faith</hi> to beleeve <hi>there was ſafety,</hi> where was <hi>no means of ſafety.</hi> And therefore hee choſe rarher to <hi>go down to</hi> Egypt, <hi>than to abide at</hi> Jeruſalem. And if that mans reaſon might direct it, 'twas the likelieſt way: for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97371:112"/> in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was nothing but <hi>Penury, Want, Famine</hi> and <hi>War:</hi> In <hi>Egypt</hi> there was <hi>Plenty, Peace, and all abundance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now obſerve. Though the way were never ſo likely, yet following his own wiſdome, and rejecting the counſel of God: I ſay, following his own wiſdome and counſel, and neglecting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of God; hee ran upon his own ruine; it was his utter undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. You ſee there, the thing hee thought hee ſhould avoid, hee fell into: Hee thought to have avoided the <hi>Sword, Famine,</hi> and <hi>Peſtilence:</hi> but all theſe followed him. God would make him know, it was better to follow the guidance of <hi>Faith,</hi> though the way were never ſo dangerous, unlikely, to carnal wiſdome, than to bee led by his own wiſdome, though 'twere never ſo likely. Men that would avoid danger out of Gods way, do ſurely run into it. Hee that will follow his own wiſdome, not Gods, ſhall run into miſchief.</p>
                     <p>You ſee this in <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> It was a likely project in carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in mans way; <hi>To continue his Throne and Kingdome, by making of Calves; that ſo the people might bee kept from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and might not revolt back to</hi> Judah. But in Gods way; it was the way to his <hi>ruine,</hi> the <hi>overthrow of him, and all his houſe.</hi>

                           <item>4. <hi>The Fear of Hell.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>5. <hi>The Fear of Judgement.</hi>
                           </item>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith establiſheth the heart againſt humane Fears,</hi> the fear of men. <hi>Faith</hi> will baniſh theſe unlawful and tyrannical fears. It will not ſuffer them to enter the Throne, and take poſſeſſion of the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1.3.—<hi>The Lord is my light and my Salvation.</hi> There was his <hi>Faith — Whom then ſhall I fear? The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, Of whom then ſhall I bee affraid? Though an host ſhould incamp againſt mee, my heart ſhall not fear:</hi> in another Pſalm. — <hi>God is our hope and ſtrength, a help in trouble ready to bee found. Therefore will not wee fear, though the Earth bee moved, though the Mountains bee hurled into the midſt of the Sea,</hi> Pſal. 46.1, 2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith doth eſtabliſh us againſt the Fear of Want.</hi> Many there are that fear to out-live their labours, to out-live their Riches, their Comforts. Oh! ſay they, I ſhall one day want, and bee in miſery.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Faith</hi> ſettles the ſoul againſt theſe fears. Why, will <hi>Faith</hi> ſay, hath not God ſaid, — <hi>The Lions ſhall hunger and ſuffer want.</hi> (That is, as the Septuagint read it) <hi>the mighty Nimrods,</hi> the great ones of the World, who have their baggs full: They ſhall <hi>ſooner want, than they that fear the Lord, ſhall want any thing that's good.</hi> Why will <hi>Faith</hi> ſay, — <hi>Doth God cloathe the Lillies, feed the Ravens; and will hee not take care for thee?</hi> Mat. 6.24. to the 34. — what? hath not God ingaged himſelf to <hi>bear thy charges to Heaven?</hi> Hath hee not promiſed to <hi>give thee all things neceſſary both for life and godlineſs?</hi> not only for <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> for <hi>Spirituals:</hi> but for Life too, for <hi>Temporals?</hi>

                     <p>Hath <hi>not Godlineſs the promiſe of this Life, that now is, and of that, that is to come?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doth <hi>God take care for Ravens, for the Beaſts of the field?</hi> Doth hee <hi>feed his Enemies? and will hee forget his friends?</hi> Hath hee <hi>given thee a Chriſt?</hi> and doubteſt thou hee will <hi>give thee a crumb?</hi> will hee not <hi>give us all things, who hath not withheld himſelf from us?</hi> Thus the Apoſtle doth reaſon,<note place="margin">Nonnè dabit ſua, qui non d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. — <hi>Hee that ſpared not his own Son, but freely gave him for us: how ſhall hee not with him, freely alſo give us all things?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sure hee, who truſts God for his ſoul, will truſt God for his Body. <hi>Faith</hi> doth not ſingle and chuſe out its Object; to beleeve this, not that, but all comming from the ſame Truth,<note place="margin">Fides non eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git Objectum.</note> the ſame God; it beleeves one as well as another. Hee who depends on God for the many, will depend on him for the leſs: Hee who truſts God for pounds, will truſt him alſo for pence. — <hi>If I tell you earthly things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Nicodemus) and you beleeve not: how will you beleeve, if I tell you heavenly things?</hi> So, <hi>if you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve God for earthly things; how can you beleeve him for heavenly things?</hi> If not <hi>for ſuſtentation:</hi> how then <hi>for ſalvation?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith doth stabliſh the heart againſt the Fear of Death; the King of Fears,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> calls it: And <hi>of all terribles, the moſt terrible,</hi> as the Philoſopher ſpeaks. Unbeleef doth ſlay the heart with fears. A man, that knows not what ſhall become of his ſoul to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: no marvel if hee bee afraid to dye.</p>
                     <p>When a man ſhall lye upon his death bed, and knows not whither hee ſhall go. <hi>Quo vadam neſcio.</hi> As it was ſaid of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> I go I know not whither: Or, when a man ſhall look upon death, and Hell behinde it: upon the Pale Horſe, and Hell behinde, as wee have it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. no marvel if hee bee afraid to dye.</p>
                     <p>But when by <hi>Faith</hi> wee can look upon <hi>God a Father: Christ a Saviour;</hi> and can ſay, — <hi>God is my God; Chriſt is my Chriſt; Heaven is my Inheritance; Glory is my portion:</hi> no marvel then, if <hi>death bee not terrible,</hi> no marvel then if hee bee ready to meet death, and ſay with <hi>Simeon — Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</hi> Or with <hi>Paul,</hi> ſigh out, <hi>Cupio diſsolvi:</hi> I deſire to bee diſſolved, and to bee with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men that have not aſſurance of a better life, it is no wonder if they bee loath to leave this: they know not where to mend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Earth in Poſſeſsion, is better than Heaven in Reverſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when God hath given a man the aſſurance of a better life; when a man hath his hope in his hand, his evidences ſealed; Oh! then death is not terrible: There will bee a willing Reſignation of the ſoul into Gods hands.</p>
                     <p>I'ts true, in ſome caſe, <hi>Hee that beleeves</hi> maketh not haſte, but here, the more wee beleeve, the more haſte wee make to bee with God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Faith Stabliſheth the heart againſt the Fear of Hell. Faith</hi>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:97371:114"/> knows who was <hi>in pretium,</hi> as well as <hi>in premium,</hi> and beholds <hi>Chriſt</hi> not only <hi>in Premium,</hi> to intitle us to Heaven; but <hi>in pretium,</hi> as the price of our Redemption, to <hi>free us from Hel.</hi> As by his Active Obedience hee anſwered Gods commanding and remunerative Juſtice: So by his Paſſive Obedience hee anſwered Gods condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vindictive Juſtice, freeing us from that wrath and miſery, which otherwiſe wee ſhould unavoidably have fallen into.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Faith doth eſtabliſh the heart against the Fear of Judgement.— There ſhall bee no condemnation to ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Beleevers.</hi> The Judge is our Advocate, our Saviour; Hee, to whom wee are to anſwer, hath anſwered for us: Hee, to whom wee are to give ſatisfaction, hath ſatisfied for us: Hee is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who hath laid down his life for us. <hi>Faith</hi> knows <hi>Chriſt</hi> will bee <hi>All,</hi> in <hi>All</hi> to the ſoul, not only in life to preſerve it, but in death to comfort, and in Judgement to abſolve thee, and ſave thee.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith doth eſtabliſh the heart againſt falling,</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. <hi>Againſt Total Apoſtacy.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Againſt Final Apoſtacy.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Againſt Total.</hi> There is not a <hi>Total Apoſtacy.</hi> Though the Saints fall ſadly, yet not <hi>Totally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Child of God may loſe all the comforts of ſpiritual life: yet not ſpiritual life it ſelf. Hee may bring himſelf into ſuch a ſad condition by ſin, that hee may ſin away all the comforts of this life. Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.— <hi>Restore to mee the joy of thy Salvation.</hi> Hee had not loſt life, but the comforts of it; and deſires they may bee reſtored. A man may out-live the comforts of life: this is a ſad thing to out-live comforts here, but <hi>Faith,</hi> at leaſt, layeth the grounds of thoſe comforts that are endleſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A man may loſe all the Vigorous and Powerful Operations of Grace, and Life: yet not life it ſelf. It may bee with a Child of God, as with a man in a dead Swoon; though there bee life in him; yet the operations of life are but little diſcerned. It's not with him, as it was wont to bee. Hee thinks to go out (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Sampſon</hi>) in prayer, &amp;c. but his ſtrength is gone from him, as his was. <hi>But his life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A man may loſe ſome meaſures and degrees of ſpiritual life: yet not life it ſelf. Hee may ſuffer a great decay in his <hi>Faith,</hi> a great abatement in his Love, and Zeal, &amp;c. and yet life is not loſt. Thus it was with the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> 2.5. — <q>
                           <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt Works.</hi>
                        </q> — Wee are not to think that the <hi>Church was fallen from Grace:</hi> but only from <hi>ſome meaſures and degrees of Grace.</hi> And concerning the ſame Church <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. when it is ſaid, — <hi>Shee had loſt her firſt love:</hi> it is not meant, that ſhee had <hi>loſt the Grace of Charity:</hi> you ſee the fruits of it in the ſecond and third verſes:</p>

                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Faith establiſheth the heart againſt final Apoſtacy.</hi> Though they fall foulely, yet not finally. They have the Prayer and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Power of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Merit of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Promiſe of <hi>Chriſt.

                     <p>Wee are ſaid to bee <hi>eſtabliſhed by Faith;</hi> to <hi>live by Faith,</hi> to <hi>ſtand by Faith;</hi> to bee <hi>preſerved by Faith</hi> as with a guard, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. — <hi>Wee are kept by the Power of God, through Faith unto ſalvation.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> wee are ſaid <hi>to ſubdue the fleſh; to have victory over the World; to quench the fiery darts of Satan; to bee ſaved by Faith, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed all ages give reports to us of many, who have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in Profeſſion, and yet have come to nought. Some fallen from Grace to baſeneſſe; ſome fallen from Grace to bitterneſſe; ſome from Grace to vitiouſneſs; ſome from Grace to malitiouſneſs: But theſe were never true Beleevers.

                     <p>Where there is true <hi>Faith,</hi> there is ſtability. <hi>Faith</hi> doth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the heart from falling.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith</hi> ſets a man upon a <hi>Soul-eſtabliſhing-bottome,</hi> upon a <hi>ſure Foundation,</hi> upon <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and hee is ſure who is built there: as the houſe on the Rock; ſo the ſoul on <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſafe.

                     <p n="2">2. Faith <hi>doth intereſt a man in a</hi> Soul-eſtabliſhing-Covenant: <hi>not a</hi> Covenant of Works, <hi>but of</hi> Grace, <hi>Jer. 32.40.</hi> — <q>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will never turn from them to do them good: But I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from mee, <hi>Iſa. 54.9, 10.</hi> — This is as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Noah</hi> unto mee; for as I have ſworn, that the Waters of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> ſhall no more go over the Earth: ſo have I ſworn that I will not bee angry with thee, nor rebuke thee.</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Faith</hi> hath a great influence into this, to preſerve and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the heart from falling. It is ſaid, — <hi>Wee are kept by the Power of God, through Faith to Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith doth ingraft us,</hi> and <hi>unite us to Chriſt,</hi> makes us Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not loſe either his Spouſe, or the leaſt of his Members.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith doth keep out the grand Enemy</hi> to this, <hi>ſtanding thus ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly,</hi> and that's <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> If a mans heart bee unſound, let his ſhew and appearance be what it will bee, all will come to nought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in <hi>Herod, Judas, &amp;c.</hi> If an Apple bee corrupt and rotten at heart, though the rind, and outſide bee never ſo lovely and ſpecious, 'twill not long laſt: the corrupt inſide will mar the fine outſide in the end.</p>

An induſtrious fear, not a diſcouraging fear: a faithful fear, not a deſpairing fear. A fear joyned with <hi>Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Faith</hi> mingled with fear. A man may bee fearful, and faithful.

                     <p>The <hi>Nazarite</hi> was forbidden Wine; and withal that hee muſt not taſte the Kernel of the Grape, leaſt that might bee an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to draw on the other. Wee have a ſad example in <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha, Augustines</hi> Mother. Shee looked on the Wine in the Cup; from looking, ſhee fell to liking; from liking, to taſting; from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, to ſipping; from that to drinking, and ſo to Exceſſe. Sins in Divinity are like abſurdities in Philoſophy.<note place="margin">Uno abſurdo dato multa ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur.</note> One abſurdity granted, multitudes follow.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such a Fear as makes us to go out of our ſelves, and lean and rely wholly on <hi>Chriſt.</hi> A Fear of our ſelves, of our own ſtrength, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Alas! What are wee to <hi>Adam?</hi> to <hi>David?</hi> to <hi>Solomon?</hi> to <hi>Hezekiah? Peter?</hi> men of ſweet and familiar acquaintance with God. Yet ſee what Teſtimonies of mens frailties they left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. And all this to teach us to <hi>maintain an holy Fear and Jelouſy</hi> over our own ſelves; that wee might go out of our ſelves, and lean all upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without whom wee cannot bee ſure.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>An Induſtrious Fear.</hi> Such a Fear as puts us upon all holy duties, and means for our eſtabliſhment to preſerve us. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to adde fifteen years to <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> life; yet hee was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this life, and uphold it, with food and dyet, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for life: ſo God promiſed wee ſhall not fall: yet wee muſt bee conſcionable in the uſe of all good means, whereby wee may ſtand; otherwiſe wee tempt God: and juſt it is with God to let us fall, if wee neglect Prayer, and the reſt of his Ordinances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him for our perſeverane.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>A Jealous Fear over our own hearts.</hi> They are deceitful, and wee had need to bee jealous over them, and watch. Think not thy ſelf ſo far at diſtance from any ſin, but thou mayeſt fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, if God keep thee not.</p>
                     <p>Who could bee further from Drunkenneſs than <hi>Noah?</hi> who was the only ſober man, in the drunken old World. Who from Inceſt than <hi>Lot?</hi> the only chaſte man in <hi>Sodom.</hi> Who from Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than <hi>David?</hi> Whoſe heart ſmote him for but cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment. Who from denying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> who had rather dye with him, than forſake him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee had need to bee jealous, and watch over our own hearts.</p>
                     <p>There is no place ſo good, but wee may offend in it. As the Angels in Heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. There is no company ſo good, but wee may ſin in it. As did <hi>Sarah</hi> in the Angels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>Judas</hi> in <hi>Chriſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus let us maintain theſe holy Fears in our hearts, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97371:116"/> by that bee kept from falling.</p>

                        <p>I have ſhewed you, it was the great thing, which God required to <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> of a ſinner. And you have ſeen the Excellency of this Grace laid down in many <hi>Glorious Priviledges and Royalties.</hi> You have ſeen that God hath poured more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the head of <hi>Faith,</hi> than upon any other Grace. Let all this perſwade with us, to put our ſelves upon the ſearch and tryal, <hi>whether wee have Faith or no.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Put ſuch a queſtion as this to thy own ſoul. <hi>Am I a Beleever, yea or no? Have I Faith, yea or no?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was a duty which the Apoſtle did commend to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. — <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether yee bee in the Faith; prove your own ſelves.</hi> And it is that, which, after this long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Faith</hi> I would commend to you all. <hi>That you would put your ſelves to the Tryal. Examine whether you have Faith or no.</hi> Therefore hath God given us a faculty different from all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whereby wee may reflect upon our ſelves. Many there are, who will winnow others, but not ſift themſelves: ſpel others, but not read themſelves: ſearching others rather than themſelves. But let it bee your care every one to prove and examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                        <p>The incouragement to this duty I will take from theſe two grounds.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a thing poſſible to bee known, whether you are Beleevers, yea or no.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a thing neceſſary to bee known.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a thing poſſible to bee known.</hi> Hence have wee ſo many exhortations; to examine and ſearch. If it were <hi>not poſſible to bee known;</hi> in vain were theſe exhortations. God doth not uſe to put us upon Impoſſibilities. Though God in the Law may require that of a natural man, which is impoſſible for him to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. becauſe hee gave man once ability to do whatever is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet in the Goſpel <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth require nothing of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which by Grace is not poſſible to bee done. Poſſible then it is. There is light enough in the Word; if a man will bring his heart unto it; and deal impartially with himſelf, in the ſearch, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee hath <hi>Faith</hi> or no.</p>
                        <p>The Papiſts indeed do ſay: It is a thing <hi>impoſſible to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97371:116"/> hee bee a Beleever or no. If men did know they did beleeve, then they might be aſſured of their own Salvation. But this</hi> (ſay they) <hi>no man can bee aſsured of.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Poſition clean againſt Scripture, Authority, and Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>The Scripture is plain; the Precepts of the Scripture plain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. — <hi>Let every man prove his own work. — Let every man examine himſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They who are commanded to try, may upon Tryal, know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have <hi>Faith</hi> or no.</p>
                        <p>But every man is commanded to try. God in the Goſpel doth not put us upon Impoſſibilities.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, the examples of Scripture are plain. The <hi>Eunuch a new Convert,</hi> when <hi>Philip</hi> told him, hee might bee baptized, if hee did beleeve, anſwered. — <hi>I beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> Act. 8.37.</p>
                        <p>The like of the Father of the poſſeſſed Child, when, having but a weak <hi>Faith,</hi> yet could ſay, — <hi>Lord, I do beleeve,</hi> Mar. 9.23. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.69. — <hi>Wee beleeve and know, that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the Living God,</hi> Joh. 11.26, 27. — <hi>Beleeveſt thou this?</hi> ſaith our Saviour to <hi>Martha</hi> there. Shee anſwers — <hi>Yea Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve thou art that Chriſt that ſhould come into the World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence ſaith <hi>Auguſtine — The Beleever ſeeth his own Faith whereby hee doth beleeve.</hi> Again. — <hi>as ſoon as Faith is in us,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <p>Vide fidelis ipſam fidem ſuam.</p>

                        <p>The mind is not ignorant of its own actions. When it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, it knows it ſelf to underſtand. When it diſcourſeth, it knows it ſelf to diſcourſe. When it deſires, it knows it ſelf to deſire.</p>

                        <p>Now if the naked ſpirit of a man bee able to judge of his own actions here: how much more the ſpirit of a man being helped by the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf bee a witneſs (— <hi>Hee that beleeveth hath the Witneſs in himſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10.) How much more when <hi>the Witneſs of Gods Spirit</hi> joynes with us? <hi>when the Spirit witneſſeth, what place is left for doubting?</hi>

                        <p>Is it poſſible for a man to know his vitious actions, to his humiliation: and not poſſible to know his vertuous actions, to his

                        <p n="1">1. In regard of the deceits of a mans own ſpirit. — <hi>The heart is deceitful above meaſure, who can know it?</hi> Jer. 17.9. And — <hi>take heed leſt the Light within you,</hi> Or, <hi>That Light you think to bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, prove darkneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They that are much vers'd with their own hearts, do finde an Hell of deceit in them. Mens hearts are like ſome pictures: If you look on one ſide, there's an Angel, but on the other, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                        <p>There are depths of deceit in the hearts of men, which makes the work exceeding difficult.— <hi>Every way of man is good in his own eyes. — There is a Generation of men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Agur) who are pure in their own eyes; and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such deceits there are in the heart, that if a man will take all of truſt, which comes up; hee will ſurely bee deceived.</p>
                        <p>You ſee this in the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 5.27, 28. They ſaid — <hi>Whatever the Lord ſaid unto them, they would do it.</hi> It is like, they ſpake as they meant, at that time. But hee that ſearched the heart ſaw deeper into them, than themſelves into themſelves. Hee eſpied deceits to lye low, which they were not perhaps aware of. And therefore ſaith — Oh! <hi>That there were ſuch a heart in them, that they might keep my Commandements alway.</hi> Hee ſaw, they wanted yet the <hi>Heart.</hi> This was but ſelf-deceiving.</p>
                        <p>I might inſtance alſo in <hi>Hazael;</hi> when the Prophet told him what beaſtly cruelty hee ſhould exerciſe toward the Children of <hi>Iſrael. — What!</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Is thy ſervant a Dog, that hee ſhould do ſuch belluine and beaſtly cruelty?</hi> It may bee hee ſpake what was uppermoſt: hee ſpake as hee meant for the time: hee was not aware, nor did hee diſcern the deceit of his heart: hee thought his heart to bee far from that now, which afterward hee fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                        <p>The like of the Iſraelites, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. throughout. So that you ſee, it is a matter of ſome difficulty. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Bids us not only examine; but prove. Not only to examine, and take the firſt evidence the heart gives in, but to prove whether the evidence given in, bee true. It may bee you have examined your ſelves, by the rules of the Word. Your heart hath given in an evidence for you. Why, but prove, if this evidence bee true: ſee an evidence of that evidence.</p>
                        <p>As in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, there was Light ſet againſt Light: ſo here you muſt ſet Light againſt Light. As for example. Inquiry is made, whether I have <hi>Faith</hi> or no. Anſwer is given in upon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97371:117"/> the ſcrutiny; That I have <hi>Faith.</hi> It is well. But now prove this. Why how? Set Light againſt Light. See an evidence of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. The Word ſaith — <hi>Faith purifies the heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. <hi>Faith ſanctifies the heart. Faith works by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
                        <p>Now then. Is thy heart cleanſed from filthineſs? Art thou ſanctified, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The like in another. Inquiry is made, whether a man love God, yea or no. It may bee the heart gives up this anſwer, that hee doth love God. Why, but now prove it. — <hi>Hee that loves God, keeps his Commandements,</hi> Joh. 14.15. <hi>Hee that loves God will obey him; will not diſpleaſe him. Hee who loves God will not ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſo in any other. Thus you ſee, though it bee poſſible, yet it's a matter of difficulty, in regard of the deceits of our hearts. And therefore wee are to take the more pains.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is difficult in regard of the doubts and miſ-givings of our hearts. And this at all times; if Gods Spirit come not to witneſs with our ſpirits; our own ſpirits will bee born down with doubts and miſ-givings of our unbeleeving hearts; and wee ſhall never know what our condition is.</p>
                        <p>Hence wee have theſe phraſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. — <hi>The Spirit doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with our ſpirits, that wee are the Children of God.</hi> I'ts not the witneſs of our own ſpirit, that will anſwer all the doubts and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our hearts.

                        <p>In this caſe a man may bee ignorant of his Faith and Graces.

                        <p>Oh! Thou doſt not know what wrong thou doſt to thy ſoul, in neglecting to clear and evidence this to thy ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Why, you will <hi>live without Comfort:</hi> you will <hi>dye without Comfort.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Brethren. If you would not <hi>live without Comfort,</hi> if you would not <hi>dye without Comfort,</hi> labour to evidence this to your ſouls, <hi>that you are Beleevers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Oh! It would adde much to your Joy and Comfort to <hi>know this.</hi> Many there are who live without comfort; who lye upon the rack of fears and diſcouragements, are in unſufferable troubles all their dayes.</p>
                        <p>Many, who for want of clearing this to their ſouls, <hi>that they are Beleevers,</hi> go with a ſpark in ſtead of a flame.</p>
                        <p>And as you live: ſo you will <hi>dye without Comfort,</hi> if you do not take care to evidence this to your ſouls.</p>
                        <p>And this were a ſad condition. Whatever a man hath in this life; yet when hee comes to dye, hee would willingly have all the <hi>Comfort poſsible.</hi> Though a man may bee content to go <hi>Quarter-ſail,</hi> and <hi>Quarter-wind,</hi> here in this life: yet when hee comes to dye, hee would willingly <hi>go Full-ſail</hi> to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Leſſe <hi>Comfort</hi> may ſerve a man to live by, than to dye by: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, whiles a man lives, other things come in, to make up the want of <hi>Comfort:</hi> every thing caſts in ſomething, to make the ſoul a ſtock of <hi>Comfort.</hi> But if this will not do; if a man cannot peece up his Comforts with other things: yet, whiles a man lives, there's hope and expectation ſtill of more Comfort.</p>
                        <p>But, when a man comes to dye, that hope is gone. There's no hope then of ever getting more. And this is a ſad condition.</p>
                        <p>And, My Brethren, It is a thing which God doth often deny at death: becauſe wee have been no more ſolicitous to clear our Evidences in our life. I ſay, God doth now withhold the Comfort of <hi>Faith;</hi> becauſe wee have neglected to clear our Evidence of <hi>Faith;</hi> which is a ſad condition. Though the condition of the ſoul bee never the leſs ſafe: yet the condition is leſs comfortable to our ſouls.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>It's neceſſary in reſpect of our more lively obedience.</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this, will make us lay out our ſelves for God. It will make us induſtrious and active, in all holy Obedience. It will make us <hi>burn out,</hi> not <hi>ſmother out: wear out,</hi> not <hi>rust out.</hi> It will make a man a <hi>Volunteer</hi> in Gods work: to ſweat and take pains in the Vineyard of the Lord.</p>
                        <p>It's falſe what the Popiſh Doctors ſay. <hi>That the knowledge of our good condition ſhould ſlack the hand, make a man Supine and remiſs in holy Obedience.</hi> As much as it will make a Travailer ſlack his pace, becauſe hee knoweth hee is in his way, and that by making ſpeed in it, hee ſhall come to the end of his journey.</p>
                        <p>Oh then! <hi>Is it a thing poſſible to bee attained? Is it neceſſary?</hi> why then are wee ſo injurious to our ſelves, to rob our ſelves of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97371:119"/> that Comfort, which the Knowledge of our <hi>Faith</hi> would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to our ſouls afterward.</p>
                        <p>Do you delight to know all things elſe? and bee ignorant of your ſelves? will you prove all things elſe? and not your ſelves? you will prove your Gold; you will prove your Silver; you will prove your Evidences, and will you not prove your ſelves? There's nothing of worth that a man will take upon truſt, without tryal.</p>
                        <p>Do you delight to bee kept upon the rack of fears, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of ſpirit? do you delight to hang between Heaven and Hell? As <hi>Abſolom</hi> between Earth and Heaven? and not know what ſhall become of your eternal ſouls to all eternity?</p>
                        <p>Why, if you do not thus, then take ſome pains in the <hi>ſearch and examination of your ſelves. — Prove your ſelves whether you are in the Faith or no?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus having premiſed this, upon which I have on purpoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the more largely; in reſpect of the <hi>Neceſſity of this duty of Self-Examination;</hi> wee will now come to lay down ſome Rules, whereby wee may diſcover to them, who are willing to take pains in the <hi>ſearch of their own hearts,</hi> whether they have <hi>Faith,</hi> or no.</p>
                        <p>In the laying down of which, that I may not erre, I ſhall deſire to go by theſe two Rules.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The grand Rule is, the Word of God.</hi> The Book ſhall try you. That Book that ſhall ſave or damn you at the laſt day; ſhall try you now whether you have <hi>Faith</hi> or no.</p>
                        <p>And I hope, if the Word convince you, <hi>that you have not Faith;</hi> you will ſubſcribe to the conviction. If the Word ſay it, I hope you will conclude it. But, whether you will or no, <hi>That which the Word ſaith is true.</hi> That conviction which the Word doth faſten upon you, ſhall lye upon you at the great day, if now you get it not off.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The Second Rule</hi> I ſhall deſire to go by, is this, <hi>to lay down ſuch Evidences</hi> as are <hi>univerſal;</hi> and belong to <hi>all Beleevers, weak,</hi> as well as <hi>ſtrong;</hi> the <hi>leaſt degree of ſaving Faith,</hi> as well as the <hi>higheſt meaſure of it.</hi> I ſhall deſire ſo to <hi>comfort the ſtrong,</hi> as not to <hi>diſcourage the weak:</hi> ſo to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> the <hi>strong,</hi> as I may alſo <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> the <hi>weak.</hi> For</p>
                        <p>I conceive, There's a great Error committed in the laying down of Evidences, to take an Evidence from the higheſt degree of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As when wee ſhould lay down an Evidence of <hi>Faith,</hi> wee take our Evidence from <hi>Aſſurance.</hi> This is a great Error. By this means wee ſhall caſt out many thouſands, who are <hi>true Beleevers,</hi> and yet <hi>want Aſſurance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And yet my care ſhall bee, as not to quench the ſmoaking flax; ſo not to cheriſh a falſe flame: as not to diſcourage the meaneſt;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97371:119"/> ſo not to encourage the ſtrongeſt, if falſe: as not to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a true, ſo not to countenance a falſe. But that the falſe may have no Comfort; the true no diſcouragement.</p>
                        <p>Now the Method, that I will obſerve, to evince this to your ſouls, whether you have <hi>Faith</hi> or no, ſhall bee ſome Evidences taken,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>From the uſual manner of Gods working of this Grace of Faith, in the hearts of Unbeleeving men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Grace it ſelf wrought in the ſoul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>From the manner of Gods working this Grace,</hi> which is this.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>God doth uſe to diſcover ſin to the ſoul;</hi> Awakens a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; makes a man to ſee his ſin, and his miſery by reaſon of ſin; that hee lies under the wrath of God by reaſon of ſin; and that there's an utter impoſſibility in him, to winde or free himſelf out of this condition.</p>
                        <p>This is the firſt work. Men will not beleeve, nor come over to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> till they firſt bee humbled, till they ſee and feel the <hi>want of Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This you ſee in the <hi>Prodigal:</hi> in the <hi>Woman</hi> with the <hi>Bloody Iſſue.</hi> It was <hi>Miſery</hi> brought them home. Men muſt bee cut off their <hi>own ſtock,</hi> before they can bee ingrafted upon <hi>another.</hi> Thrown off their <hi>own bottom,</hi> before they can caſt themſelves on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>true Foundation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Termes</hi> of Mercy are <hi>too hard;</hi> the <hi>Yoke of Chriſt</hi> is <hi>too ſtrait</hi> for ſuch men, who were never <hi>humbled. What! To deny themſelves! to cut off their right hand! to forſake their beloved ſins!</hi> But <hi>Mercy</hi> upon any <hi>Termes</hi> to the <hi>humbled</hi> is <hi>deſireable.</hi> No <hi>Potion</hi> can bee <hi>too bitter</hi> for the <hi>Recovery of a dying man:</hi> No hard <hi>hold too ſharp</hi> for a <hi>drowning man,</hi> to take hold of. So <hi>no Termes too hard</hi> for <hi>an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereas, before a man bee <hi>humbled,</hi> the Propoſition of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Pardon</hi> is but <hi>all loſt labour.</hi> Hee makes <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Mercy, Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, Light</hi> of a <hi>Pardon,</hi> as they did, that were <hi>invited to the Supper.</hi> It's ſaid — <hi>They made Light of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Men will not ſeek after the Phyſitian, before they feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to bee ſick: for eaſe, till they bee preſt with burdens: for a Plaiſter, before they bee wounded: for heavenly Riches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſenſe of their ſpiritual beggery: for inlargement, and pardon, before they bee in Priſon: for Mercy, before they ſmart under the ſenſe of Miſery: <hi>Nor for a Chriſt,</hi> till the ſoul do finde a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the want of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence the Law is ſaid to bee our Schoolmaſter to bring us to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And it is upon this ground, among others; <hi>becauſe it doth diſcover ſin to us;</hi> and laſh us, and humble us for it. And then wee are ready to go from <hi>Sinai</hi> to <hi>Sion: from the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>accuſing, to the Goſpel of Chriſt excuſing: from the Law condemning, to the Goſpel abſolving.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>This God diſcovers. <hi>Faith</hi> muſt have a <hi>bottom</hi> to reſt on: An <hi>Al-ſufficient Saviour.</hi> No man will throw his ſoul away.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>With the fulneſs,</hi> God diſcovers the <hi>freeneſs of this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all commers:</hi> How willing God is to beſtow <hi>Chriſt</hi> on you; and how willing <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to beſtow himſelf upon you.</p>

                        <p>Thoſe things God intended not for growth, hee made perfect at firſt; as the Sun, the Moon, &amp;c. But thoſe hee intended for growth, hee at firſt makes imperfect; as Men, Beaſts, Plants, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Chriſt</hi> compares <hi>Faith to a grain of Muſtard-ſeed.</hi> Not to <hi>a ſtone,</hi> but to <hi>a ſeed.

                        <p n="4">4. Where <hi>Christ</hi> is precious indeed, all of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is precious. Hee is not only precious in his Perſon, in his Natures, in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: but all of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is precious.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt in his Holineſs, Chriſt in his Lawes, Chriſt in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Chriſt in his Truth. The ſoul looks upon all theſe as prizes of Chriſt. Hee who prizeth of Chriſt, doth prize of all theſe.</p>
                        <p>As wee ſay of <hi>Faith;</hi> It doth not <hi>eligere Objectum;</hi> it doth not chuſe its Object; ſingle out what it will beleeve, and what it will

Thus much of <hi>Chriſt</hi> I will prize, and thus much not: But there is a full prizing of all <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> in his Holineſs, Lawes, Government, Truth, All.</p>
                        <p>All which are parts of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and are all to bee prized, if ever you would clear this, that you prize of <hi>Chriſt</hi> truly.</p>
                        <p>And without queſtion, Gods people have ſeen ſo much Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Laws, Government and Holineſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they have loſt all, rather than they would loſe their Obedience.

They have ſeen ſo much beauty in a Truth, that they have hazarded and loſt all, rather than they would loſe a Truth. They have made this brave adventure, <hi>to loſe themſelves, to ſave a Truth;</hi> as you ſee in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, in point of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                        <p>In theſe particulars a weak <hi>Faith</hi> ſhareth ſtakes with a ſtrong: But for what is more peculiar to a ſtrong <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Strong in <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſtrong in <hi>Grace.</hi> According to the proportion of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſuch is the meaſure of all Gods Graces in us.

                        <p n="1">1. Strong in <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſtrong in <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are two things which make the ſoul to love <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The diſcovery of the Beauties, and excellencies of Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apprehenſion the ſoul hath in the intereſt it hath in this Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now both theſe are in a ſtrong <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a full diſcovery of the Beauties and Excellencies of Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Beauties of his Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Beauties of his Nature, &amp;c.</hi> And that in a larger meaſure, than is made known to a weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever.</p>
                        <p>A weak <hi>Faith</hi> ſees the <hi>Excellencies of Chriſt in puncto:</hi> in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row room: as wee ſee the World in a Map: But a ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> it ſees all the <hi>Excellencies of Chriſt, in circumferentiâ:</hi> Hee ſees a larger, and fuller draught, hath a fuller diſcovery of it to his ſoul.</p>
                        <p>And who can ſee it, but hee muſt needs love him, who is <hi>all lovely;</hi> who hath <hi>all Beauties?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That Eye of <hi>Faith,</hi> which beholds the <hi>Beauties</hi> and <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Chriſt,</hi> will bee a <hi>Burning-Glaſs</hi> to the heart, to <hi>ſet the heart on fire, and kindle ſtrong affections there.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. There is (in a ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi>) a ſtrong apprehenſion of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97371:124"/> ſouls intereſt in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is his, and hee is <hi>Chriſts:</hi> His Blood and Merits his, for Pardon, for Juſtification: His Grace and Holineſſe his, for Sanctification: His Wiſdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his, for Direction; And therefore the ſoul muſt needs love him.</p>
                        <p>Propriety wee ſee in things makes us love them. Wee love our own Husbands, our own Wives, our own Children. The ground is this; the propriety wee have in them.</p>
                        <p>So when the ſoul once ſees Chriſt made over to him; that hee hath a propriety in him, an intereſt in him; needs muſt the ſoul love him.</p>
                        <p>So you ſee then; where there is a ſtrong <hi>Faith,</hi> there is a ſtrong <hi>Affection</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Such a love as no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is too hard to undertake for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no task too great to poſe his love to <hi>Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was ſaid of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that hee indured many years ſervitude for <hi>Rachel:</hi> yet hee thought the time ſhort, all was nothing, <hi>becauſe hee loved her.</hi> So all wee can do for <hi>Chriſt, all will bee nothing,</hi> if wee once love him.</p>
                        <p>Nay; not only <hi>all wee can do;</hi> but <hi>all wee can ſuffer will bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> to the ſoul that <hi>loves him. — Love is as ſtrong as Death.</hi> You ſee it in the Apoſtles, <hi>They counted not their lives too dear to give to death, for the Love of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not the Bloud which is in the veins, the ſpirits, which are in the arteries, the Life, in the Body, which will be too dear.</p>
                        <p>There is a kinde of unquenchableneſſe in Love, like the ſtone in <hi>Thracia,</hi> which burns in the Water. — <hi>Much Water cannot quench Love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Much Afflictions from God cannot quench our Affections to God. As all our dealings to God doth not alter Gods affections to us: ſo all Gods dealings to us, will not alter our affections to God — <hi>Si diligis, Domine, fac quicquid vis,</hi> was the ſpeech of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin: Lord, if thou love mee, do what thou wilt.</hi> And <hi>Jobs — Though thou kill mee; yet I will ſtill truſt in thee.</hi> And the Church profeſſeth the like, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17, 18, 19.— <hi>All this is come upon us, yet do wee not forget thee, nor have wee dealt falſely in thy Covenant. Our heart is not turned back; nor have our ſteps gone out of thy paths: Though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Much afflictions for God ſhall not cool our affections to God. Wee ſhall bee ready to go through a Sea, through a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, through the ſharpeſt incounters for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nothing ſhall poſe a ſtrong <hi>Beleever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When once the ſoul is perſwaded of the Love of God by <hi>Faith,</hi> then there follows abundance of love to God again, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. from 15. to 19.— <hi>Whoſoever confeſſeth that Jeſus is the Son of God, in him dwelleth God, and hee in God. And wee have known and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Love that God hath to us. God is Love; and hee that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97371:125"/> in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. &amp;c. wee love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee loved us firſt.</hi> And that of <hi>Mary. — Much was forgiven her, and therefore ſhee loved much.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whiles a man looks upon God as an enemy, who hates him; hee can never love him; But, when once the ſoul by <hi>Faith</hi> doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Gods love to him; then doth the ſoul love God again. <hi>The love of God begets love in the ſoul to God.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Amor Dei a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem animae parit.</note> No mans heart is warmed with the ſenſe of Gods love, but it is inflamed with love to God again.</p>
                        <p>As the Sun beams ſhining upon a Glaſſe, begets a reflection of the Beams upon the Wall: So the <hi>Love of God ſhed abroad in our hearts, breeds a reflection of love back again to God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Strong in <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſtrong in <hi>Hope,</hi> and expectations of the thing beleeved: which is that which holds up our head, and keeps the ſoul from ſinking, in the midſt of all theſe worldly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Strong <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſtrong <hi>Patience.</hi> A ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> will bear ſtrong <hi>Afflictions,</hi> with ſtrong <hi>Patience. Faith</hi> doth ſtrengthen a mans ſhoulders to bear evils and troubles with Patience.</p>
                        <p>A weak Tree is blown down with that which moves not a ſtronger Tree. Weak ſhoulders ſink under that burden, which a ſtrong one will bear away. So a weak <hi>Faith</hi> would ſink with that tryal, which a ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> is able to undergo, with ſtrength of Patience. And therefore it is Gods goodneſſe ſtill to proportion the Tryal to the ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>A ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> can receive a mercy and bee thankful; and can render a mercy, and bee patient.</p>
                        <p>A ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> can injoy a bleſſing, and bee chearful; and can loſe it, and bee contented.</p>
                        <p>Hence ſaith <hi>Paul. — I have learned in all eſtates, therewith to bee content. I know how to abound, and how to ſuffer want, &amp;c.</hi> Hee was a man ſtrong in <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the ground of all is this, becauſe a ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> having dear evidence and apprehenſions that God is a Father, doth conclude that all his dealings are for good. — <hi>All things ſhall work together for good, to them that love God.</hi> And hee hath ſaid, — <hi>Hee will never depart from us, from doing us good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Faith,</hi> like the Philoſophers ſtone, turns all into Gold; ſees all Gods dealings to bee for good.</p>
                        <p>If God then afflict a man; why, will <hi>Faith</hi> ſay, <hi>It's for good. I have need of ſuch Afflictions, to work out ſuch a ſtrong corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Are the Afflictions many? why, will <hi>Faith</hi> ſay, <hi>I have need of many Afflictions, becauſe I have many corruptions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Are they long? why, <hi>I have need of that too: becauſe ſin and I are ſo hardly parted:</hi> It is ſo hard to make a divorce betwixt ſin and my ſoul; and therefore the afflictions had need to continue long.</p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:97371:125"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Faith</hi> ſees that God aims at this, <hi>to wean us from the World, to win us cloſer to him, to exerciſe and increaſe our Graces, to weaken ſin and corruption, to make us more fruitful.</hi> Therefore doth hee prune us, that wee might grow more. If a man lop Trees at ſometimes, they will wither and dye: but if at other times, they will be made more fruitful. God uſeth to afflict the wicked at ſuch time. But the Saints, when they may grow the more. Therefore God win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows us, fannes us, to blow away the chaff: Therefore hee puts us as Gold into the fire, that wee may come out much more pure.</p>
                        <p>Strong <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſtrong <hi>Obedience. Obedience</hi> is proportionable to our <hi>Faith.</hi> The greater the <hi>Faith,</hi> the more the <hi>Obedience.</hi> A little Tree, a young Tree may bring forth good fruit, as well as a greater: but not in equal quantity to the greater: ſo hee that hath the leaſt degree of true <hi>Faith,</hi> lives a godly life, brings forth ſome fruits of Obedience: but they are not ſo plentiful in good works, as thoſe, whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> is come to an higher degree.</p>
                        <p>Weak <hi>Faith</hi> doth obey; and this Obedience is <hi>a willing, a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a fruitful, a conſtant, an univerſal Obedience,</hi> both,

                        </p>
                        <p>There is a willing yeelding of the ſoul up to God, to walk in every way of God. As <hi>David, Lord, I am thine;</hi> or as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah. — One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords.</hi> Otherwiſe it were not true Obedience.</p>
                        <p>But they are not able to act ſo much as the ſtronger. They are as large in deſires, in affections to obey: but not in expreſſions of Obedience.</p>
                        <p>But the ſtronger the <hi>Faith,</hi> the ſtronger is the Obedience, the ſtronger the Will, the ſtronger the Affections, and the ſpirit in his Obedience.</p>
                        <p>A Child may do actions as well as a Man; but not with that ſtrength, as a man doth them: hee cannot do them ſo ſtrongly, ſo vigorouſly.</p>
                        <p>A weak Beleever may pray, hear, &amp;c. but not pray ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo powerfully; as others, who have more <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that you ſee, where there is ſtrong <hi>Faith,</hi> there is ſtrong Obedience. A ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> will follow God fully in every way. In loſing waies, as well as in gaining waies: In ſuffering waies, as well as in doing waies: In diſcountenanced waies, as well as in ſuch as the World doth countenance: In ſtrait waies, as well as in broad waies: in rugged waies, as well as in plain ſmooth waies: In difficult, as well as in eaſie waies.</p>
                        <p>You ſee this in <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the ſacrificing of his ſon: In which act hee might ſeem to diſobey in his Obedience: And the dutiful yeelding to it, might ſeem to contradict duty.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The ſoul will yet conclude it, though it cannot clear it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, when it cannot ſee it. The <hi>ſtrong Chriſtian lives by Faith, not by feeling;</hi> and knows God may bee <hi>His God,</hi> though by ſenſe it bee not diſcerned, but that <hi>God is not his God.</hi> You ſee this, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. — <hi>My God!

                        </p>
                        <p>And therefore, when the eye of Senſe and Evidence is put out; yet hee hath the eyes of <hi>Faith,</hi> to ſee and beleeve.

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Say hee takes an argument from Gods outward dealings in chaſtiſing and afflicting of us, and ſay; <hi>If God loved thee, hee would not ſo afflict thee: If God were thy Father, hee would not ſo chaſtiſe thee.</hi> However the weak <hi>Faith</hi> may bee born down with ſuch a temptation as this; yet the ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> is not moved with ſuch a

That I might not love the World, therefore hee ſuffers the World to frown on mee. That I might bee crucified to the World; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſuffers mee to bee crucified in the World. Becauſe I am a Child, therefore hee afflicts mee. — Hee ſcourgeth every Son, whom hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth,</hi> Rom. 12.6, 7, 8.9, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>God takes liberty to chaſtiſe our bodies, to ſave our ſouls. And God loves tenderly, when hee corrects ſeverely, <hi>Job</hi> 5.17. <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.11.</p>
                        <p>Thus doth a ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> hold up the concluſion of <hi>Faith</hi> againſt all the Reaſonings of Satan againſt it.

                        <p>You ſee it was thus in <hi>Job.</hi> — When God had taken away his goods; when his hand was upon his body, and upon his ſpirit too, not only withdrawing himſelf from him; but poſitively inflicting of his diſpleaſure upon his ſoul: yet all that Satan could do by himſelf, all that hee could do by his friends, who joyned with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in the battel, could not make him unſay, what his heart and the Spirit of God had ſo often ſaid; nothing ſhall make him to eat his own words.

                        <p>You ſee the unbeleeving Noble Man, when the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> told him in that great famine, that the next day there ſhould bee ſuch great plenty.

                        <p>God may work wonders, and yet in an ordinary way. You ſee here in this Famine. A wonder it was, that they ſhould have ſuch plenty, in ſo ſhort a time. And it was too big for the noble mans <hi>Faith</hi> to beleeve. But yet you ſee it was a wonder wrought in an ordinary way.</p>
                        <p>The like you ſee in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Pſal. 78.19, 20.— <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs? Indeed hee ſmote the Rock, and the waters guſhed out. But can hee provide fleſh for his people alſo?</hi> One would have thought that the former experience of Gods power ſhould have ſatisfied them in this: that they that granted the one, could not have denyed the other; that God was able to do that alſo. But the former was over, and here was a new ſtrait they were in; and they ſaw no means how it ſhould bee effected; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not beleeve it.</p>
                        <p>The like of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> Iſa. 7.11, 12.

                        <p>And many ſuch <hi>Ahazes</hi> wee have in the World. They think, to truſt in God in the abſence of means, is to tempt God. What, ſay they, <hi>doth God work wonders, that hee ſhould do this without means?</hi> Why God can do wonders, and yet in an ordinary way.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>strong Faith</hi> will truſt <hi>without means. God is not truſted at all, if not truſted alone.</hi> If wee take in any thing with God, in our truſt, wee truſt not God at all, as wee ought.</p>
                        <p>When men are brought to the loweſt ſtrait, they are neareſt to the higheſt God. And then will <hi>Faith</hi> work beſt, when it works alone; and then is God neareſt to help, when mans ſtrength is ſmall. <hi>Mans extreamity is Gods opportunity.</hi>

                        <p>The ancient Tragedians, when things were brought to that paſs; that they ſaw no poſſibility of humane help, they uſed to bring down ſome of their Gods. Hence that Proverb. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>A ſtrong Faith can take long Delaies well at Gods hand. — Hee that beleeves, makes not haſte.</hi> Such a man can wait upon Gods time, for the beſtowing of a Mercy. Such a man knows that God hath a fulneſs of time to beſtow mercy in.</p>
                        <p>And as it was ſaid of the ſending of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (that <hi>univerſal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> that <hi>ſummum genus of Mercy) when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent his Son:</hi> So when the <hi>fulneſs of time is come,</hi> God will ſend us our deſires; beſtow the Mercy. And therefore hee can wait.</p>
                        <p>A weak <hi>Faith</hi> is quickly worn out, it cannot wait; if God come not preſently, it is caſt down, and can wait no longer. You ſee this in the <hi>Two Diſciples going to</hi> Emmaus. — <hi>Wee hoped that this ſhould have been hee that ſhould have delivered</hi> Iſrael; <hi>but hee is dead: and this is the third day.</hi> They might have waited a little longer; they were too quick and haſty: what though the third was come, it was not yet expired: great things might have been done yet before night. But weak <hi>Faith</hi> is impatient of delayes. — <hi>This evil proceedeth from the Lord: ſhall I wait on him any longer?</hi> was the voice of that wicked King, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33. — <hi>Every viſion faileth,</hi> Ezek. 12.22. ſo they, and too often many better than they.</p>
                        <p>But now a ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> will hold out in delaies; yea, and pray more earneſtly. As you ſee <hi>David</hi> did: who though — <hi>his Eyes failed, his Fleſh failed,</hi> though <hi>his Heart failed,</hi> yet hee renewed his ſupplication from day to day. The like in <hi>Daniel;</hi> in the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of</hi> Canaan; in <hi>Hannah;</hi> and in the <hi>Blind man,</hi> hee was blamed for his importunity; and was yet the more importunate.</p>
                        <p>Such a man knows, that hee who hath any thing from God muſt <hi>continue in Prayer.</hi> Jacob, <hi>all night.</hi> David, <hi>day and night.</hi> Jonah, <hi>three dayes and nights.</hi> Daniel, <hi>one and twenty dayes and nights.</hi> Moſes, <hi>forty dayes, and forty nights.</hi> God often defers his people, to <hi>inhance, and raiſe up the price of mercy, to make them more fit for mercy, more thankfull for mercy.</hi> And therefore hee can wait.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Strong <hi>Faith</hi> cannot only take long delaies; But denyals
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97371:130"/> well. It can ſubmit to denials, as well as to grants. You ſee it in <hi>David.</hi> Hee had ſtrong deſires for the continuance of the life of his Child. God denyed it. See how calm, how ſubmiſſive hee was, in the denyal; inſomuch that hee was a wonder to all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                        <p>A weak <hi>Faith</hi> doth faint and is diſcouraged at the denyals of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. It cannot tell how to take a denyal of God: but a ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> can take denyals as well as grants.</p>
                        <p>A ſtrong Faith is clear in this, that God is a Father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his denyals are in mercy: all is for good: hee knows, if God hear him not according to his will,<note place="margin">Etſi non ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ad ſanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note> yet according to his good.</p>
                        <p>A ſtrong <hi>Faith</hi> ſubmits to Gods wiſdome, and Gods will, who is the <hi>only VViſe.</hi> Wee may deſire a thing at Gods hand, and in our wiſdome may judge it to bee good: But God in his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who knows the iſſue of things, ſees it will bee for our hurt; and therefore denies it. And <hi>Faith</hi> ſubmits to his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and follows him; as a blinde man his guide.</p>
                        <p>Wee may ask ſome things too earneſtly, which are more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably denyed, then granted. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of <hi>Adonijahs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſo I may ſay of many of ours: Wee ask our lives, wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our Bane, ſuch things as would hurt us, and undo us. And are not thoſe things mercifully denyed, which without hurt cannot bee granted? This is to croſs us with a Mercy. A child deſires a knife of the Father, The Child ſees no hurt in it: but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth. And ſhall wee not then ſubmit to the Wiſdome of our Father?</p>
                        <p>A man may deſire this evil to bee taken away; this croſs, this affliction to bee removed; this temptation, this corruption to bee taken away. God denies it, ſeeing it beſt for a man to bee exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with them. And <hi>Faith</hi> will ſubmit.</p>
                        <p>Again, a man deſires this outward mercy; it may bee Riches, may bee Honours, the great things of the World: And thinks (it may bee) if God did raiſe him, hee would raiſe God: if God would make him great, hee would make God great.</p>
                        <p>But now God denies this. God ſees it is better that thou want them, than injoy them. And <hi>Faith</hi> ſubmits to Gods Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Voluntas Dei optima; &amp; ſi optima, opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma vult.</note> and to Gods Will in it. <hi>Gods Will is his will:</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Not my will, but thy will bee done. Gods will is the beſt, and being beſt, wills what is the Beſt both for his own glory, and our good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again; thou deſireſt ſome ſpiritual mercy from God. Perhaps thou deſireſt <hi>Perfection of Grace in this life:</hi> and God ſees it is better that corruptions ſhould dwell in thee, as the Lees among the Wine, to keep the Wine ſweet, to humble thee; or that they might bee as pricks in thy eyes, and goads in thy ſides, to make thee more forward and fervent in holy performances.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps thou deſireſt a great deal of Knowledge with <hi>Saul,</hi> to bee higher by the head and ſhoulders, than thy fellow Chriſtians:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97371:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> Or with <hi>David, to bee wiſer than thy Teachers:</hi> God denies it; and <hi>Faith</hi> takes the denyal: knowing all is for the beſt. It may bee, it might beget pride; this would puff up; it would bee too great a ſail for ſo ſmal a Boat; and rather over-turn thee, than ſet thee forward.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps thou deſireſt to injoy the <hi>continual light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> to bee like the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes, in perpetuo Sole:</hi> in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Sun-ſhine. But God denies it, thou art ſometimes in the valley of tears, as well as ſometimes in the Mountain of Joy. Thou haſt cloudy and clear dayes, calmy and ſtormy ſeaſons. And <hi>Faith</hi> ſubmits to this denyal. It ſees all is for the beſt.

                        <p>But inaſmuch as in us lies, wee make God untrue, make him a Lyar. Our unbelief doth give God the real lye in all.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Unbelief</hi> is the <hi>Womb of ſin.</hi> If you could rip up <hi>Unbelief,</hi> you ſhall finde all ſin in the bowels of it.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Unbelief</hi> is both the <hi>Entertainer,</hi> and <hi>Maintainer of ſin.</hi> It is not only the <hi>Mother,</hi> but the <hi>Nurſe of ſin.</hi> Every ſin doth ſuck the <hi>dug of Unbelief.</hi> It is a <hi>ſin-ſuccouring,</hi> a <hi>ſin-nouriſhing ſin.</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Breeder,</hi> but the <hi>Feeder</hi> of ſin.

                        <p>Sin goes to Unbelief for protection, and there it hath it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief will bee a ſhield to keep off any blow that is given to ſin.</p>
                        <p>Sin goes to Unbelief for ſecurity; and unbelief ſecures and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants ſin: ſin dwelleth where unbelief keeps the houſe; ſin ſits down ſecurely under the ſhadow of unbelief.

                        <p>Sin goes to unbelief, not only for defence, but for maintenance: and unbelief will maintain ſin: it will fetch in proviſion for luſt. It is not only the Entertainer, but the Maintainer of ſin. It ſhall want no morſels: unbelief will furniſh it.</p>

                        <p>Nay, not only <hi>damned,</hi> but the ſoreſt <hi>damnation</hi> of all; the <hi>deepeſt Cellars of Hell,</hi> the <hi>loweſt Vaults of Hell</hi> are reſerved for ſuch, who are <hi>Unbeleevers now under the Goſpel. — This is condemnation,</hi> (that is, <hi>the ſoreſt condemnation) That Light is come into the VVorld: (that a Chriſt is tendred to you, a Chriſt</hi> is offered to you) <hi>and men love darkneſs rather than light:</hi> yet men will not beleeve, <hi>John</hi> 3.19.</p>
                        <p>There is no fall into Hell, like ſuch an one as is taken at a ſtumble at <hi>Chriſt:</hi> No <hi>damnation</hi> like that, which is pronounced in the <hi>Court of Mercy.

                        </p>
                        <p>As the <hi>ſowreſt Vineger</hi> comes from the <hi>ſweeteſt VVine,</hi> ſo out of the <hi>ſweetest Mercy,</hi> the <hi>ſoreſt condemnation.</hi> It will bee <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> times eaſier for thoſe, who are <hi>condemned under the Law;</hi> their torments will not bee ſo <hi>heavy, Hell</hi> will not bee ſo <hi>hot</hi> to them, as to ſuch who are <hi>now condemned under the Goſpel.</hi>

                        <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Unbelief is a remedileſs ſin.</hi> Such a ſin as there is no <hi>remedy</hi> for it, no <hi>plaister</hi> for it.</p>
                        <p>All other ſins have a <hi>Remedy,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Remedy:</hi> But <hi>unbelief denies the Remedy.</hi> There is a plaiſter for <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> for <hi>Swearing,</hi> for <hi>Murder, &amp;c.</hi> All other ſins have a <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is that <hi>Plaiſter:</hi> But <hi>Unbelief denies the Plaiſter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God gives the <hi>Mercy</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> to all other ſins; if ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law, and condemned by the Law: yet hee tenders the <hi>Mercy</hi> of the <hi>Book.— Hee that beleeveth ſhall bee ſaved.</hi> But <hi>Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> rejects this <hi>Mercy:</hi> It will not read.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Law condemn us,</hi> wee are ſuffered to <hi>appeal</hi> to the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> If <hi>Juſtice condemn us,</hi> wee are ſuffered to <hi>appeal</hi> to <hi>Mercy.</hi> As you ſee the <hi>Publican,</hi> who was <hi>arraigned, ſentenced,</hi> and <hi>condemned by the Law:</hi> But hee <hi>appeals to the Court of Mercy. — God bee merciful

                           <hi>Unbelief</hi> makes every Ordinance of God unprofitable to us. What is the reaſon that men <hi>hear the Word,</hi> and get no more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; but becauſe they <hi>beleeve not?</hi> Heb. 4.2. <hi>The Word preached did not profit them, becauſe it was not mingled with Faith in them that heard it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Do you think the <hi>word of Threatning</hi> could bee heard, and you not bee <hi>humbled,</hi> if you did beleeve the Truth of all? who were able to lift up his head, nay to ſtand under the threats of the great <hi>God of Heaven and Earth,</hi> if hee did <hi>beleeve?</hi> It is ſaid — <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils beleeve and tremble,</hi> Jam. 2. And had you but as much <hi>Faith</hi> as they to <hi>beleeve</hi> the truth of what God threatens againſt ſin, it would make the <hi>ſtouteſt ſinner of you all to tremble.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And do you think the word <hi>Promiſing, Beſeeching, Intreating</hi> could bee ſo unprofitable, if you had <hi>Faith</hi> to mingle with it, to apply it to your ſelves?</p>
                        <p>It is, becauſe you bring no <hi>Faith</hi> to the Word, that the Word of God is not a <hi>raiſing, a quickening, a comforting word to your ſouls:</hi> That it is not an <hi>inlightening, a convincing, a converting,</hi> and <hi>a reforming word.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So for the Sacraments. Could theſe bee ſo unprofitable? could you live under them, and get no further victory of luſt? no more increaſe of <hi>Grace,</hi> if you did bring and exerciſe <hi>Faith</hi> here, to fetch from this treaſure opened.</p>
                        <p>It is neceſſary to every Ordinance, neceſſary to your Callings; neceſſary to every condition. Wee had need of <hi>Faith</hi> to go
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97371:133"/> through all the conditions of this life: Through <hi>Proſperity, Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, Sickneſs, Health: Loſſes</hi> and <hi>Injoyments.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaid of <hi>Patience,</hi> the <hi>Daughter,</hi> ſo I ſay of <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>Mother. — You have need of Faith, that after yee have ſuffered the Will of God, yee might inherit the Promiſe,</hi> Heb. 10.36.</p>
                        <p>If our condition bee proſperous, wee had need of <hi>Faith,</hi> to ſee all is for good, and need of <hi>Faith,</hi> to inable us to make a good uſe of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>You had need of Faith, to ſee the Tenor of your injoyments;</hi> That you injoy them, not only <hi>out of leave,</hi> but out of <hi>Love:</hi> not only from a <hi>general Providence;</hi> but from a <hi>particular Promiſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>You had need of Faith, to ſee further than your preſent Eſtates:</hi> to look upon theſe <hi>pence,</hi> and <hi>farthings</hi> as <hi>earneſts of better things:</hi> as ſomething in hand for thoſe things in hope.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>You had need of Faith, to ſee the heart of the giver in the gifts; his Affection, in the expreſſion; the God of Mercy, in the injoyment of Mercy; to taſte the fountain in the stream.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>An unbeleeving man hee is not able to clear this; Hee may have proſperity in Judgement, and heap up Riches to his <hi>own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;</hi> All his <hi>Wealth</hi> may bee but <hi>fuel</hi> to that <hi>fire,</hi> to make <hi>Hell hotter;</hi> as Oile to kindle the flame of luſt, ſo fuel to increaſe the fire of torment hereafter.</p>
                        <p>So if our condition bee troubleſome and afflicted, wee had need of <hi>Faith</hi> to ſee all is for the beſt, and need wee had of <hi>Faith,</hi> to make the beſt uſe of it, to <hi>humble us, wean us, winne us, &amp;c. Faith</hi> can ſee good in all; making all good to him, though in themſelves never ſo evil.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>There are Motives drawn from the excellency of Faith.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more of it, but what I have already ſaid, and you may read in theſe ſeveral <hi>Royalties of Faith</hi> already laid down.</p>

                        <p>There's ſafety in the Tower, when all other ſorts and Bulwarks are gone; when Out-works are taken, and Walls are ſcaled, there is yet ſafety in the Tower.</p>
                        <p>So here: when all Out-works are gone, when all our Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeem to bee gone, when nothing appears to comfort us; yet the <hi>Name of the Lord</hi> is a ſtrong Tower to flye to, a rock to reſt on; whereupon being exalted, wee are delivered from danger, and ſet out of gun-ſhot.

                        <p>Let us then caſt anchor here, and wait till the time of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come; wait till all ſtorms and clouds bee blown over — <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.</hi> But wee muſt wait with the Husbandman with patience, till the crop bee throughly ripe.

                        <p>Godly ſecurity, and apprehenſion of ſafety do not ever attend the act of <hi>Faith</hi> at the heels. To truſt is the act of <hi>Faith;</hi> and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

                        <p n="1">1. Frequent the powerful and ſincere preaching of the word of God; a <hi>Faith-begetting-means. Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.17. <hi>True Faith is the Daughter of Mercy.</hi> For this end God hath ſet up this Ordinance in the Church, that it might bee a means for the begetting <hi>Faith</hi> in the hearts of unbeleeving men. And God doth often in the opening of Scripture, open our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that wee may beleeve, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.45. <hi>John</hi> 20.31.</p>
                        <p>And in the hearing of the Word, keep thy Ear open, to hear what God ſaith by his Spirit in the Goſpel. <hi>Faith</hi> comes not by mercy of the Law, but of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>And in the Goſpel, dwell upon <hi>Faith-breeding-Promiſes.</hi> Indeed, all the Promiſes tend to beget <hi>Faith:</hi> but eſpecially ſuch, wherein the good Will of God, and the Heart of God is diſcovered: ſuch wherein the freeneſs and richneſs of Gods Promiſes are diſcovered.</p>
                        <p>Promiſes are of two ſorts.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Either ſuch as are conditional; granted upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſome duty in us. As ſuch as theſe. — <hi>Beleeve, and thou ſhalt bee ſaved. — Repent; and thy ſins ſhall bee forgiven thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Or ſuch as are made and performed in meer Mercy; ſuch wherein God promiſes to give that condition which hee requires to the Promiſe.</p>
                        <p>Wee have not only promiſes of giving pardon, and remiſſion to the beleeving ſinner: but wee have promiſes of beſtowing <hi>Faith</hi> upon the unbeleeving ſinner.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome Promiſes wherein wee are to bring <hi>Faith</hi> to the Promiſe. As here — <hi>whoever beleeves ſhall bee ſaved,</hi> And</p>
                        <p>There are ſome Promiſes that wee muſt go unto for <hi>Faith.</hi> Some that wee muſt bring <hi>Faith</hi> to; and ſome that wee muſt go to for <hi>Faith:</hi> as thoſe free and abſolute Promiſes — <hi>I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your ſtony hearts, and give you hearts of fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſuch wherein hee hath ſaid, — <hi>Hee will work all our works in us, and for us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Oh! ſay ſome; If I had but ſo much Repentance; ſo much brokenneſs of heart; if but ſo much love, then I could beleeve. Alas! wee muſt not bring our penny to the Promiſe. We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and then all the reſt will come in. The way to have a broken heart, is to beleeve, The way to repent, the way to love God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond Ordinance is Prayer. Though none of this <hi>Faith</hi> bee in Heaven; yet all <hi>Faith</hi> comes from Heaven. — <hi>It is the gift of God.</hi> And therefore wee are to ſeek to him for it.</p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:97371:136"/>
                        <p>Wee may joyn our ſelves to <hi>Faith-begetting-means;</hi> But it is God that muſt make the means effectual, for the working of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a grace above the power of man; and therefore requires the power of God to work it. I ſay</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>It requires the Power of God.</hi> Nay, not only the Power; but</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>It requires the greatneſs of his Power.</hi> Nay</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The exceſs of greatneſs of his Power.</hi> Nay</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>The mightineſs of that exceſs.</hi> Yea and</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>The working of all this mighty Power.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. where wee have all thoſe five particulars ſet down.</p>
                        <p>And therefore there is need of calling in for all the help of God, all the power of God for the working of it.</p>
                        <p>It is the hardeſt thing in the World to caſt a man out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: to cut a man off his own ſtock: to throw a man off his own foundation.</p>
                        <p>And when that is done, it is as hard a work to bring this man over to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> to make a man to lye full and flat upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Grace, for mercy.</p>
                        <p>And therefore how much need is there of ſtirring up our hearts? How much need of calling in for the ſtrength of God by prayer?</p>
                        <p>This is the ſecond. Prayer is a fruit of <hi>Faith;</hi> and yet prayer is a means for the begetting of <hi>Faith.</hi> As the Spirit is a fruit of Prayer; ſo prayer is a fruit of the Spirit. As you ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. In the one place the Spirit is ſaid to bee the fruit of Prayer. — <hi>Hee will give his Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> In the other, Prayer is the fruit of the Spirit. — <hi>You have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby you cry abba, Father.</hi>

                        <p>But in particular, cheriſh theſe three thoughts.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The conſideration of thy own vileneſs, and emptineſs; thy ſin, and miſery by reaſon of ſin. And this will drive thee out of thy ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The conſideration of the fulneſs, riches, and al-ſufficiency of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> who hath all fulneſs in him; who is able to ſave to the utmoſt: a bottome able to hold up any weight of ſin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The conſideration of the freeneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. God keeps open houſe; invites, intreats; beſeecheth us to beleeve and come in.— <hi>Ho! Every one that thirſteth, come yee to the Waters, come buy yee that have no ſilver, and eat. Come buy Wine and Milk without mony, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 55 1. And — <hi>Hee that comes to mee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 6.37.) <hi>I will by no means cast out.— Let him that will come; whoever hath a mind, let him come.</hi> Bee his ſins what they will bee for nature, for number, for continuance: yet come and finde acceptance. — <hi>Who is a God like unto thee! That pardoneſt iniquity, and paſſeſt by the tranſgreſsions of the Remnant of thy heritage! Thou reteineſt not anger for ever; for thou delighteſt to ſhew mercy,</hi> Mic. 7.18.</p>
                        <p>There are two things when men are humbled, which keep them off from beleeving, either,
<list>
                              <item>1. <hi>A doubt of Gods Power — Lord if thou canſt.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. <hi>A doubt of his Will.— Lord, if thou wilt.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Some doubt of his Power. Oh! Is God able to pardon ſuch a ſinner as I have been? Can hee pardon ſo great, ſo bloudy, ſo crimſon ſins? If they were but ſuch, or ſuch, I ſhould not doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But being ſo great: how can God pardon!</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Others doubt of his Will. They will bee ready to ſay. They know there is a fulneſs of Power in God: hee is able to forgive my ſins; let them bee what they will bee: hee hath a Sea of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, able to drown Mountains as well as Mole-hills. But alas! I doubt of his Will: whether hee will ſhew mercy to ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, if ever you would beleeve, you muſt get an heart convinced of the 1. Fulneſs and al-ſufficiency of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to pardon. 2. And of the freeneſs and willingneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſhew mercy, to ſuch as do beleeve.</p>
                        <p>Dwell upon ſuch conſiderations as theſe are, being means to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Faith.</hi> When men are once convinced of the fulneſs of God, they will come over to him, if withall they bee fully convinced of their own need.</p>
                        <p>It is poſſible for a man to beleeve this fulneſs in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97371:137"/> not bee able to clear his acceptance. Wee read of the Lepers, who ſeeing nothing but death in their condition, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.3, 4, reſolved not to ſtay there, but to go over to the Camp of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. — If they ſave us alive</hi> (ſay they) <hi>wee ſhall live: and if they kill us, wee can but dye.</hi> And there were many reaſons, which might cauſe them to expect no better, but death from them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They were Jews, and ſo their enemies.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They might bee ſuſpected for Spies.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If not: yet they were <hi>Lepers, good for no ſervice:</hi> ſuch as might <hi>infect the whole Camp.</hi> Yet ſeeing their Miſery, in want of bread, and knowing that there was bread to bee had: they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to adventure.</p>
                        <p>So, if there were but a through diſcovery</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Of our own Miſery,</hi> a conviction of that.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the fulneſs and all-ſufficiency of Chriſt;</hi> it were poſſible ſo far to prevail with a man, as to throw himſelf on <hi>Chriſt;</hi> though hee bee not yet able to clear, whether God will ever accept him.</p>
                        <p>But when wee take that other conſideration in, and do think of the <hi>ſweetneſs, and freeneſs of Gods love and mercy to accept of poor returning ſinners:</hi> what ſhould then hinder, but the ſoul ſhould come over, and beleeve in him? And therefore, if ever thou wouldeſt have <hi>Faith,</hi> cheriſh theſe thoughts, dwell much upon ſuch conſiderations as theſe.</p>
                        <p>Men ſay, they would beleeve; but in the mean time, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cheriſh ſuch thoughts and conſiderations as may beget <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If there bee any thing in the Word which makes againſt them; this they will harbor and cheriſh: they will feed upon the Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and the Gall: but if there bee any thing to nouriſh and cheriſh <hi>Faith,</hi> this they will ſuppreſs.</p>
                        <p>They have an ear open to hear what the Law, what ſin, what Satan ſaith: but none to hear what God ſaith in the Promiſe.</p>
                        <p>They will promote the Devils cauſe, his arguments, ſharpen his weapons againſt themſelves: But they will ſilence the pleadings of Gods Spirit in them.</p>
                        <p>They will look upon the dark ſide of the Cloud, not the light ſide. The threatnings of the Law, they will apply, and ſet on with all their might: But if Promiſes come they finde no acceptance with them.</p>
                        <p>They will nouriſh conſiderations of their ſins, their guilt, their miſery, by reaſon of ſin; and aggravate it to the utmoſt: but the <hi>thoughts of Gods Love, of the freeneſs of his Mercy, of the promiſes of pardoning ſins,</hi> theſe they reject.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>My Brethren;</hi> This is not the way to get <hi>Faith.</hi> If ever you would <hi>beleeve,</hi> you muſt <hi>ſtudy the freeneſs of Gods Mercy in Chriſt; his willingneſs to pardon and forgive poor ſinners, if they come over to him.</hi>

                        <p>One would have thought his bare word had been enough, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Truth, and ſufficiency of the Perſon, that ſpake it.</p>
                        <p>But hee hath given his Oath. Nay, but hee reſted not there: but his Seal too: The Sacraments. And therefore make uſe of them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Bee much in Prayer; that God would ſtrengthen and increaſe thy <hi>Faith.</hi> Prayer is the fuel of <hi>Faith;</hi> the food of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A man may as well live without meat, as <hi>Faith</hi> without Prayer. As the ſoul lives by <hi>Faith:</hi> ſo <hi>Faith</hi> lives by Prayer. <hi>Faith</hi> helps Prayer, and Prayer helps <hi>Faith</hi> again.</p>
                        <p>As there is a Communion among the Ordinances; every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance doth help another. The Word helps Prayer, and Prayer helps the Word: So there's a Communion between Ordinances and Graces. Faith helps Prayer, and Prayer helps Faith. Prayer cannot ſay of <hi>Faith — I have no need of thee:</hi> nor <hi>Faith of Prayer — What need have I of thee?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As there is a mutual dependence of one Chriſtian on another, a means to nouriſh Communion, as Chriſtians help one another; One may ſay — <hi>Help my Zeal, and I will increaſe thy knowledge; ſtrengthen my Faith, and I will inflame or kindle thy affections:</hi> ſo here, There is a mutual dependence between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer. Faith</hi> ſaith to <hi>Prayer, Help mee to beleeve,</hi> and <hi>I will help thee to pray:</hi> And <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>Faith, Help mee to pray, and I will help thee to beleeve.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such a Communion there is. And therefore bee much in prayer for ſtrength.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Live much in the Heaven of the Promiſe. Feed upon the freeneſs, and ſweetneſs, and fatneſs of the Promiſe. Delight your ſelves in fatneſs. Let your way lye much above; live much out
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97371:138"/> of your ſelves. This is your way. A man ſhall never bee able to ſtrengthen <hi>Faith,</hi> that lives in himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Walk in the Earth of the Law.</hi> As <hi>Faith</hi> ſtrengthens Obedience: ſo Obedience ſtrengthens <hi>Faith.</hi> As <hi>Faith</hi> multiplies, ſo let duty multiply. The way to nouriſh the one, is the way to increaſe the other.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Make it your chief riches, to bee rich in Faith.</hi> And then all your deſigns and indeavours will bee for the increaſe of it. The wordly man labours, toils, ſweats here for the World: And what is the reaſon? but becauſe hee makes this his riches; ſo it is here.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Exerciſe Faith much.</hi> And this is the way to increaſe it. Men that can imploy a greater meaſure of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſhall have it. Bee careful that the exerciſes of <hi>Faith</hi> may bee proportionable to the meaſure of <hi>Faith</hi> received. It is the way to get it increaſed.</p>
                        <p>God will not have the ſtock lye dead in our hands. Hee will not give more than wee can imploy. The Talents were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeveral abilities. Some had two, ſome one, ſome five.

                        <p>Exerciſe Grace. For within the compaſs of the exerciſe of Grace, lies that which will nouriſh and increaſe Grace.</p>

                        <p>Men are often injurious to the increaſe of <hi>Faith</hi> by unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for that meaſure they have. Wee are too much like cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men, looking after further degrees ſo much, as to overlook that which God hath already beſtowed. Our complaints would bee others contents: others would bee glad of them.</p>
                        <p>Therefore let us get an heart inlarged for the meaſure wee have. It is the way for God to inlarge his hand, to beſtow more upon us.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Maintain Humility; an humble ſpirit. God gives Grace, and hee gives increaſe of Grace to the humble. Humility is the Nurſe of Grace.</hi> The empty heart ſhall bee filled. Nature abhors empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Grace much more.</p>

                        <p>It is very orderly, that works ſhould follow <hi>Faith.</hi> Your works of Charity, our Doctrin of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Papiſts do charge us that wee cry down works, and preach nothing but <hi>Faith, Faith;</hi> making it <hi>Titulum, ſine Re.</hi>

                        <p>And I could not poſſibly have taken up a better ground for works, than to preach the Doctrin of <hi>Faith</hi> firſt.</p>
                        <p>Indeed wee preach <hi>Faith</hi> without works <hi>in Juſtificationem,</hi> as touching Juſtification. But wee ſay, <hi>Faith</hi> and works muſt go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in our converſation.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Faith</hi> doth Juſtifie our Perſons: ſo works do juſtifie our <hi>Faith.</hi> And thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by works: his works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him to bee juſt.</p>
                        <p>Good works are the breath of <hi>Faith;</hi> as the word in <hi>James</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies.<note place="margin">

                        <p>So you ſee, wee ſet up works too; though wee cry them down in the matter of Juſtification.</p>
                        <p>Are good works good for nothing; becauſe not <hi>good to justifie?</hi> The Sun is not good to give light to blind men. Is it therefore good for nothing? Gold is not good to aſſwage hunger. Is it therefore of no uſe?</p>

                  <p>From the forty fifth verſe, to the end of this Chapter, there is contained a diſcourſe 1. Between <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> And then 2.

                  <p n="1">1. Chriſts profeſſion, or commendation of him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. <hi>Jeſus ſaw</hi> Nathaniel <hi>comming to him, and ſaith of him; Behold an Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite indeed, in whom is no guile.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Either by way of queſtion, being convinced that hee ſpake right, and that hee diſcovered his heart to him, hee demands how it came to paſs, that hee knew his ſpirit ſo right; as though hee had ſaid, it is true, I deſire to walk uprightly and ſincerely with God, but how canſt thou tell that? how is this diſcovered to thee? art thou able to judge of the heart? none knoweth that but God only.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or the words may bee conceived as a blunt and more rude reply; <hi>whence knoweſt thou mee?</hi> you never ſaw mee before, nor I you; and how then can you give ſo high a commendation of one you are no more acquainted with?</p>
                  <p>And I take them in this laſt ſenſe, becauſe hee came with ſuch a prejudice againſt Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 40.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſts further and clearer manifeſtation of himſelf to him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 48. Jeſus anſwered, before <hi>Philip</hi> called thee <hi>under the Fig-tree I ſaw thee;</hi> as though hee had ſaid, I there ſaw enough to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſincerity.

                  <p>Here you ſee that Chriſt paſſeth by his failings; which were</p>

                  <p>In the Text obſerve three general parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An open commendation of <hi>Nathaniels</hi> Faith, <hi>becauſe I ſaid, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſilent reprehenſion of others unbelief. <hi>Beleeveſt thou?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A gracious promiſe of future and fuller Revelation, <hi>thou ſhalt ſee greater, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Perſon commending, Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Perſon commended,</hi> Nathaniel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The thing for what; his readineſs to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The ground of his Faith, becauſe I ſaid, I ſaw thee under the Fig-tree, beleevest thou?</hi> as if hee had ſaid, doth ſo ſmall a thing induce thee to beleeve, I have wrought no miracles, raiſed no dead, &amp;c. I ſhall do greater things in the ſight of others, <hi>heal the ſick, give ſight to the blinde, cleanſe the Lepers, caſt out Devils, raiſe the dead;</hi> and yet many of them will not beleeve.</p>
                  <p>For the promiſe of fuller Revelation; the words are, <hi>thou ſhalt ſee greater things than theſe:</hi> which is promiſed,</p>
                  <p>Either as a reward of his former Faith, or for the increaſe of his preſent Faith, and in theſe words hee points at what after miracles hee would do. Thus you ſee the parts of the Text laid open to you; but there is one thing yet which is neceſſarily to bee unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Text, before wee leave the general view of it, which is the ground of his beleeving, which was Chriſts ſaying; <hi>that hee ſaw him under the Fig-tree.</hi> The queſtion is</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſo ſmall a thing as this, ſaying, that hee ſaw him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fig-tree, could bee likely to produce ſo noble a confeſsion and profeſsion of Chriſt, or make him to beleeve?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Wee will not now ſpeak of Gods working by it, for ſo wee know nothing is ſo ſmall, but by his working in, and by it, may prove admirably efficacious; as on the contrary, if hee work not, no thing, though never ſo great otherwiſe, and ſeemingly promiſing, will bee able to do any thing, as wee ſee in the Jews, who although they ſaw his miracles; ſuch as none but a God could do, yet they beleeved not.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:97371:143"/>
                  <p>Wee will conſider the thing in it ſelf, and ſo I finde theſe two things in it, which might draw out ſuch a confeſſion, and make him put forth ſuch an act of Faith. <hi>Becauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the Fig-tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may bee hee was then taken up with the meditation of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> who was to come; for at this time their thoughts were all full of it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.25.48. and ſo God might now ſuggeſt to him, that hee would reveal him to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or it may bee out of evidence and conviction of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence of Chriſt; that hee could ſee him under the Fig-tree. <hi>Nathaniel</hi> thought that hee had been alone, and no eye had ſeen him; and therefore when ſuch an evidence was brought to his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that Chriſt ſaw him, yea, not only his perſon, and outward actions, but his heart alſo, hee was thereupon convinced of the divinity of Chriſt, and ſo cryeth out, <hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. But you will ſay, <hi>How did this diſcover that Chriſt was the Son of God, or the divinity of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Hee knew that corporally hee was not there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although his eyes told him, that Chriſt was a man, yet in that when abſent, hee could ſee him under the Fig-tree, it did diſcover and declare him to bee God. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I think this ſpeech of Chriſt, which was the ground of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniels</hi> Faith; had not only relation to his ſeeing of <hi>Nathaniels</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but to ſome ſpecial peece of ſervice which <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was then upon. Either meditation, prayer, or the like, which Chriſt ſaw, and his heart in it, as if Chriſt had ſaid, I ſaw not only thy perſon under the Fig-tree, but alſo the workings of thy ſpirit there; I ſaw in them the uprightneſs and ſincerity of thy heart, and the goings out of thy ſoul, when thou wert there alone; which brought ſuch a conviction of the divinity of Chriſt with it, that it made him cry out, <hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of</hi> Iſrael; thou who knoweſt the heart muſt needs bee God, &amp;c. as if a man ſhould ſay to his friend, thou art one that art charitable, mourneſt for thy ſin, and in caſe hee ſhould anſwer, but how know you that? hee ſhould reply, did I not ſee ſuch an act of charity which you did? did I not ſee you mourn bitterly for ſin at ſuch a time, &amp;c? this in ſome reſemblance commeth ſomewhat near to this inſtance, but yet falleth ſhort, becauſe wee judge of the outward act, Chriſt here of the inward, which manifeſted him to bee God omniſcient, the ſearcher of the heart, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſhewed you the coherence with the parts of the Text, and have in part unfolded what might ſeem difficult and obſcure in it.</p>
                  <p>Now there are ſome Doctrines which lye about the verge of the Text; ſome from the perſon commending, ſome from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon commended, and ſome from the thing, for which. But I ſhall
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97371:143"/> touch only upon thoſe which ariſe from the main ſcope of the Text; and they are two.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That the eyes of Chriſt run through the whole World, and behold the evil and the good.</q>
                  <p>Hee that ſaw <hi>Nathaniel</hi> under the Fig-tree, ſeeth thee in all places, in all companies, &amp;c. to this purpoſe read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>Amos</hi> 9.2, 3, 4. Hee is <hi>totus oculus,</hi> all eye, to ſee, and all hand to feel and finde out. Hee who is to bee Judge of all the actions, and waies of men, muſt neceſſarily know them all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Say not then, that God ſees not, ſay not that darkneſs ſhall cover thee, <hi>eſto quod nemo, non tamen nullus,</hi> though no man, yet ſome eye ſeeth thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. This may bee comfort to the Saints. Chriſt ſees you under the Fig-tree, ſees you in a corner, ſees your perſons, your actions, your ſpirits: Hee ſees your prayers, hee ſees your tears, hee ſees your afflictions, your preſſures, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Hee hears your groans, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. This is terror to wicked men, hee ſees them too, hee ſees your malice againſt his Saints, your vileneſs and abominable filthineſs. I ſaw you in ſuch a place, at ſuch a time, in ſuch and ſuch pollutions, in which thou wouldeſt have been loath, in which thou would have been confounded, if men ſhould then have ſeen thee.</p>
                  <p>From the commendation of <hi>Nathaniels</hi> Faith. Obſerve, <q>
                        <hi>Doct. 2.</hi> That ſuch is the goodneſs of God, that hee commends us for that which is his own.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee commends <hi>Nathaniel</hi> here for that Grace which hee had given him. God works graces in us, and then commends us for them: hee gives us mony, and then commends us for our riches; hee makes us beautifull, and then commends us for our beauty, in which hee doth only beautifie his own beautie, and love his own graces in us. Hee doth here commend <hi>Nathaniels</hi> Faith, which yet was only the Faith of his own powerfull working. Hee commends <hi>David</hi> for his uprightneſs, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for his perfectneſs, <hi>Moſes</hi> for his meekneſs, <hi>Cornelius</hi> for his devotion, the Publican for his compunction, the poor Widdow for her liberality, and the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> for her Faith and importunity; all which was only the work of his own Grace in them. God will finde matter of love and liking in us, from that which is his own; hee can paſs by ours, and own his. As a Father loveth his child for that which is of his own nature in him, and ſo doth God in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Then ſee what a ſweet Saviour wee have, who will paſs by our imperfections and deformities, and take notice of his own beauties in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. And accordingly wee ſhould learn to look upon our ſelves, as Chriſt doth, though black in our ſelves, yet beautiful in Chriſt; although I would have you to own, and to bluſh at your

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mities; yet not ſo as to blinde your eyes from beholding Chriſts excellencies, as in himſelf, ſo in you by his grace, take the ſhame of your own ſins, but let God have the honour of his own Graces; by this you ſhall nouriſh your humility, and yet not weaken your Faith, you ſhall abhor your ſelves, and yet extoll Gods free Grace.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are but by the way, to which many others might bee added. I will fall upon thoſe which the Text doth more fully hold out, and they are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That ſlowneſs of Heart to beleeve,</hi> is a temper of ſpirit very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to God; this is hinted in the implied tacit reprehenſion of others, whilſt hee ſo commends <hi>Nathaniels</hi> forwardneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God takes it well at our hands, or it is very pleaſing unto God, when wee will beleeve in him upon ſmall Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That God will reveal great things to them, who do ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee greater things than theſe,</hi> it is a promiſe of future and fuller manifeſtation to bee vouchſafed to him.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſhall begin with the firſt, which is <q>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> That ſlowneſs of heart to beleeve, is a temper of ſpirit very offenſive unto God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not ſtand long to clear the truth of this Doctrin, if you look into <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.50. that high commendation of <hi>Nathaniels</hi> Faith, is a ſilent upbraiding of others for their <hi>ſlowneſs of heart to beleeve. Becauſe I ſaid, I ſaw thee under the Fig-tree, beleeveſt thou?</hi> It is as if hee had ſaid, for that without queſtion is implied; why I have done greater things in the ſight of othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. <hi>I have healed the ſick, opened the eyes of the blinde, raiſed the dead, caſt out Devils, and yet they have not beleeved.</hi> And doth ſo ſmall a manifeſtation work on thee. <hi>Becauſe I ſaid, I ſaw thee under the Fig-tree, &amp;c.</hi> I have not raiſed thee from the dead: implying hee had done it to others. And hence hee is ſaid to upbraid thoſe Cities wherein his mighty works had been done, becauſe <hi>they beleeved not,</hi> Mar. 16.14.</p>
                  <p>And this was a great aggravation of their ſin, where ſo much had been done to perſwade them to beleeve, yet ſlow, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The like in <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.37, 38. <hi>But though hee had done ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles before them, yet they beleeved not on him, that the ſaying of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah <hi>might bee fulfilled, who hath beleeved?</hi> here was a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſin.</p>
                  <p>And upon this ground hee reproveth his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25, 26. <hi>Oh fools and ſlow of heart to beleeve all that the Prophets have ſpoken, ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his glory, &amp;c?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how often doth hee upon the ſame ground rebuke his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. <hi>O yee of little Faith!</hi> Mar. 9.19. <hi>O faithleſs Generation how long ſhall I bee with you? how long ſhall I ſuffer you?</hi> Implying, it put Chriſt to the utmoſt of his patience to bear with them in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:97371:144"/>
                  <p>Which yet if you read the ſtory, you will finde it was no ſmall work; it was becauſe they could not caſt out the dumb ſpirit out of a man poſſeſſed; which yet hee himſelf tells them afterward, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. that this was the greateſt of difficulties: this kinde came forth by nothing but by prayer and faſting, which ſhews the work was of more than ordinary difficulty: yet becauſe their Faith was poſed in it, hee tells them they were a faithleſs Generation, and hee was weary of them, it put him to the utmoſt exerciſe of his patience to bear with them.</p>
                  <p>And you ſee the like of <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe Faith was ſo great, as to carry him upon the waters; to walk upon the waves, upon a bare command and word of Chriſt; yet afterwards the wind growing ſtrong, and corruption working, hee was affraid, and begins to ſink, and then cryed, <hi>Lord, ſave mee,</hi> Mat. 14.30, 31. And how much was Chriſt diſpleaſed at him, who had put forth ſo glorious an act of Faith, as to walk upon the waters upon a bare command, yet becauſe hee held not out, Chriſt reproved him, <hi>Oh thou of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt!</hi> was this a little Faith? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But wee will paſs this, and in the proſecution of this Doctrin, wee will ſhew theſe eight things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That wee are ſlow of heart to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What are the grounds that wee are ſlow of heart to beleeve?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What are the reaſons why this ſlowneſs of heart is ſo offenſive to God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, <hi>that wee are ſlow of heart to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will bee demonſtrated to you, if you conſider with mee theſe five particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The greatneſs of that power which God doth put forth, in the working Faith in an unbeleeving heart.</p>
                  <p>Faith it ſelf is called the work of Gods power, nay, of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power. The ſame power which God put forth in the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſt from the dead, even the ſame power hee doth put forth in the working of Faith in an unbeleeving heart, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, 20.</p>
                  <p>There are many mighty works of God, which are not ſaving works. As the works of Creation, the works of Providence: Theſe are mighty works, but they are not ſaving works.</p>
                  <p>But there are no ſaving works of God which are not mighty.</p>
                  <p>Every work of mercy, is a work of might too, every work of grace, is a work of power too; though every work of power bee not a work of grace, yet every work of grace, is a work of power; And the work of an almighty power. <hi>Actus omnipotentis. Actus omnipotentioe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not only an Almighty God doth work, but alſo according to the Almightineſs of God, when hee works Faith and Grace in a graceleſs heart. There are two names given to this in Scripture, both which ſpeak the greatneſs of Gods power in the working of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:97371:145"/>1. It is called a reſurrection from death to life, not of a dead body, but a dead ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.10. <hi>wilt thou ſhew wonders to the dead, ſhall the dead ariſe to praiſe thee?</hi> hee ſpeaks not there of a natural death, but of the condition which hee was in, lying for the preſent ſlain and dead as it were, under the apprehenſions of God wrath. Shall a ſoul that now lyes dead and ſlain with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of thy wrath and diſpleaſure, ariſe by Faith to praiſe thee? <hi>Wilt thou ſhew wonders to the dead? ſhall the dead ariſe to praiſe thee?</hi> That is, wilt thou ſhew the greatneſs of thy power in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Faith in an unbeleeving ſoul; this is no leſs than a reſurrection from the dead, the dead ariſe, &amp;c. And therefore this muſt needs require the greatneſs of Gods power to effect it.</p>
                  <p>It is a great work to recover a ſick man, but more to reſtore a dying man; but to raiſe a dead man to life, this is the work of God only. Yet all this is nothing to the reſurrection of a dead ſoul</p>
                  <p>To raiſe our bodies when conſumed by fire, when vaniſhed into air, when corrupted in the water, when turned into duſt and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs, is not ſo great a work, as to raiſe a dead ſoul, a ſoul dead in ſin, to work Faith in an unbeleeving heart.</p>
                  <p>This is the Almighty work of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And hence, Secondly, It is called a work of Creation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. thus in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And you know Creation is the work of God only, it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſomething out of nothing. Men may produce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of ſomething, but to produce ſomething out of nothing is proper to God alone. There is leſſe diſtance between the leaſt duſt, and the moſt glorious Angel in Heaven, than there is between it and nothing.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſay, and its true, <hi>inter ens, &amp; non ens, nulla proportio;</hi> there is infinite diſtance between ſomething and nothing. Such a diſtance as none but a God can bring together. Now this work of Faith and Grace in the heart in an unregenerate and unbeleeving man, is a new Creation. A Creation of light in a dark heart, of life in a dead heart, of Faith in an unbeleeving heart, of Grace, in a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heart, which is a work which requires the almightineſs of Gods power for the effecting of it. And that is the firſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you do conſider the complaints of Beleevers, when they firſt come to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>What ſighs, what tears, what groans, what pains, what ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, with unbeleef, with doubts, with fears. Crying out with the man in the Goſpel. <hi>Lord I do beleeve, help my unbeleef.</hi> It may bee now the doubt of Gods power, of Chriſts al-ſufficiency to pardon ſin, to forgive ſo great and hainous wickedneſſe, and ſay with him, <hi>Lord, if thou canſt do any thing, help,</hi> Mark 9.22. or if not ſo, yet they doubt of his w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97371:145"/> thou canſt make mee clean.</hi> Matth. 8.2.</p>
                  <p>Every dayes experience tells us, how hard a thing it is to caſt a man out of himſelf, and when that is done, Oh how hard a thing is it to bring that ſoul over to Chriſt, and the promiſe! Now a thouſand objections are raiſed; the ſoul is now as full of ſcruples, of doubts, as the Sun is full of motes.</p>
                  <p>Oh what ſwarms of unbeleeving thoughts! what multitudes of doubts, and objections, that it is beyond the power of any, but of him alone that can deal with the heart, either to diſcover them, or anſwer them, or if anſwered; yet the ſoul is ſtill unſetled, till God come in. This is plain in caſt down and humbled ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you look upon the Rhetorick, God uſeth to bring a poor humbled and caſt down ſinner to beleeve. Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Comfort you, comfort yee my people, ſaith my God. Speak yee comfortably.</hi> Say, your <hi>warfare is accompliſhed, your iniquities are pardoned, &amp;c.</hi> But leaſt any ſhould ſay, alas, tell not mee of this! no comfort belongs to mee; hee is buried up in troubles; God doth not regard him: why ſee how hee ſaith in <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Why ſayest thou Oh</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ſpeakeſt Oh</hi> Iſrael, <hi>my way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgement is paſſed over from my God? Haſt thou not known, haſt thou not heard, that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary?</hi> hee giveth power to the faint, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Do you doubt of his power? why hee is <hi>the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth;</hi> and hee can pardon, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What though thy ſins bee great, yet hee tells thee, <hi>hee will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55.7, 8, 9. <hi>Let the wicked man forſake his wayes, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and hee will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for hee will abundantly pardon;</hi> the word is, multiply to pardon, as thou haſt to ſin.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, how can this bee? this is far above the thoughts of a Creature. Why but ſaith hee in the next verſe, <hi>My thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are your waies my wayes, ſaith the Lord; for as the Heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my wayes higher than your wayes, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi> But alas! there are ſuch and ſuch conditions required. Why but ſaith hee, Ho! <hi>every one that thirsteth, come,</hi> Revel. 22.17.</p>
                  <p>Do you doubt of his will? Why hee tells you: <hi>It is not the will of your heavenly Father, that any of theſe little ones ſhould periſh,</hi> Matth. 18.14. You think it is, but Chriſt ſaith it is not; hee knows the thoughts hee thinks to thee, they are thoughts of peace, and not of evill, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11.</p>
                  <p>And how doth hee ſay. As I live, I do not delight in the death of him that dyes, turn you, turn you, and live; Oh why will yee dye! <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31, 32.</p>

                  <p>Yea but this Covenant is not firm, I may ſin away mine own mercy.

                  <p>This with abundance ſuch like Rhetorick God uſeth to draw a poor humbled doubting ſinner to beleeve, and why ſhould God uſe ſuch Rhetorick to perſwade with men, if it were ſo eaſy a matter, as men make it to beleeve?</p>
                  <p>This ſhews the difficulty of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you conſider the way that God takes to confirm the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of mercy, and pardon to Beleevers.</p>
                  <p>Hee gives you his Promiſe, his Oath, his Seal; heaps Mountains upon Mountains, and all to confirm it; hee layes Heaven and Earth at ſtake, nay hee pawns his Truth, his very being, and all, to perſwade with unbeleeving men to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>God needed not to do this in reſpect of himſelf, his purpoſe was as good as his promiſe, his Promiſe as good as his oath, his oath as firm as his ſeal: hee needed not to do this in reſpect of himſelf; as if that his oath would binde him more than his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>But God hath done this in reſpect of us, to ſtrengthen our Faith, that wee might bee ſtedfaſt in God, when wee ſtagger in our ſelves, that wee might bee ſtrong in God, when weak in our ſelves. As the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. That by two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, &amp;c. God hath thus condeſcended to all this, to beget Faith in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, that if his promiſe would not perſwade with you, then his oath, if not that, yet his ſeal: The great Seal of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>You could not deſire more of the moſt faithleſs and diſhoneſt man in the World, than God hath condeſcended to, who is yet the faithfull and unchangeable God. You have a Promiſe, will not that do?<note place="margin">Vae nobis ſi nec juranti Deo tredimus.</note> you would have an Oath, will not that do? you have a Seal, witneſs, all.</p>

                  <p>Thou that thinkeſt Faith ſo eaſy, thou that never found the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97371:146"/> difficulty of it, mayeſt well think thou haſt no Faith. In this God ſhews the difficulty of beleeving, that his Promiſe, his Oath, &amp;c. are all ingaged to work and confirm it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If you conſider the complaint of the Preacher. You hear <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complaining, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath beleeved our report?</hi> or our Doctrin, as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>And Chriſt complains of the ſame, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.37, 38. <hi>Though hee had done ſo many miracles before them, yet they beleeved not on him, that the ſaying of the Prophet might bee fulfilled.</hi> viz. <hi>who hath beleeved our report?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> hee takes up the ſame complaint, as you ſee at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16, 17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Though wee have declared the wonderfull things of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the freeneſs, vaſtneſs, greatneſs of the love of Chriſt, the preciouſneſs of Promiſes, yet men beleeve not. Oh that I could not complain of thoſe, &amp;c! how many offers of Chriſt have you had? how many tenders of mercy?</p>
                  <p>How often hath Chriſt unbowel'd himſelf to your ſouls in the Promiſe! how often hath God invited, intreated, beſeeched, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Hoe <hi>every one that thirſteth come!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet ſenſeleſſe people do not thirſt, and thirſty people do not come, &amp;c. Oh! here is enough to demonſtrate that wee are <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee come to the ſecond. What are the grounds, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And wee will reduce them to theſe three general heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are ſome grounds from Satan.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some from our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some which are taken from others, which do foreſlow the heart from beleeving in the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know, I ſpeak of men awakened, and convinced of their miſerable condition, not ſuch as go on with a high hand in their ſins. I ſpeak of men humbled.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then the reaſons or grounds why wee are ſo ſlow, &amp;c. From Satan, are the deluſions and falſe ſuggeſtions of Satan.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know there are two main ſtratagems which hold up Satans Kingdome in the World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is to keep preſumptuous ſinners from being humbled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other is to keep humbled ſinners from beleeving.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe is by keeping of preſumptuous ſinners from being humbled; which hee doth theſe wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either by perſwading them they are no ſins they live in, and here hee tells the Prodigall hee is but liberal, the drunkard hee is but ſociable, the covetous perſon hee is but frugal, the proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hee is but comely, and handſome, &amp;c. wee ſay, <hi>nullam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ſine patrocinio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:97371:147"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sauls</hi> Covetouſneſs in ſparing the beſt of the flock; twas his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, 'twas his zeal to Sacrifice; the Phariſees Covetouſneſs had an act of devotion to patronize or ſet it off with. So <hi>Jezabel</hi> paints her face, to make it ſeem comely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or elſe if hee cannot perſwade them to that, that they are no ſins, but conſcience is inlightened and quickned, and checks him for them, hee cannot ſtand againſt his own light, nor under his own reproofs.</p>
                  <p>Then hee perſwades them they are but veniall, and ſmall ſins, or if great, yet pardonable, nay, and that at any time, as the Theef upon the Croſs, what? ſayes hee, God is mercifull, and if but at the laſt thou canſt ſay, <hi>God bee mercifull to mee, Lord have mercy upon mee,</hi> why then all is well, there is no doubt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe men are better verſed in the Service-book, than in the Scripture, perhaps hee will cite a Text out there.</p>
                  <p>At what time ſoever a ſinner, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt ſtratagem, to keep preſumptuous ſinners from being humbled. And if hee prevail not then, but that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe good words, a ſoul is convinced of ſin, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it; then hee hath a ſecond.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond Stratagem, and that is to keep humbled ſinners from beleeving; and that hee doth theſe wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee labours to have them deſpair of a pardon, and that upon one of theſe two grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee will now tell you, either that your ſins are greater than can bee pardoned. As <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>So it is in the Original, <hi>my ſins are greater than can bee pardoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee will ſo aggravate mens ſins, and heighten mens treſpaſſes, and ſo leſſen and ſtreighten Gods mercy, that hee will indeavour to perſwade their ſins are above a pardon, they are greater than Gods mercie to pardon; and that is the firſt way which hee deals with ignorant conſciences in trouble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or if hee cannot perſwade in that, then hee hath another way to bring men to deſpair, and that is from the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Why will hee ſay, though thy ſins are not greater than God can pardon, yet they are greater than God will pardon: hee will never bee mercifull to ſuch a wretch as thou haſt been; doſt thou think God will ever ſhew mercy to ſuch a vile ſinner as thou haſt been? what, one who hath ſinned againſt ſuch a light, ſuch means, ſuch mercies, and committed ſo horrible ſins, and continued in them. And thus hee aggravates ſin.</p>
                  <p>As before hee leſſened ſin all hee could to keep men from being humbled; ſo now hee aggravates ſin, all hee can, to keep men from beleeving. As before hee inlarged Gods mercy above the bounds of the Law, now hee inlargeth Gods Juſtice above the bounds of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:97371:147"/>
                  <p>Before hee preſented to you, Gods mercy in a falſe glaſs, to make you preſume. And now hee preſents Gods Juſtice to you in a falſe glaſs, to make you deſpair.</p>
                  <p>And indeed of the two, hee is better able to ſet out Gods Juſtice, than his Mercy, becauſe hee feels the one, and knows what it is, but hee ſhall never taſte of the other; hee can therefore better preſent Gods Juſtice as it is, than Gods Mercy as it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or if hee cannot bring men to deſpair upon theſe grounds, yet another ſtratagem hee hath to keep men from beleeving.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And that is thirdly, by telling them they are not diſpoſed and fitted for mercy, you are not broken for ſin, you do not love God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And in this ſtratagem hee labours to hinder us, by telling us wee want ſuch diſpoſitions, as follow beleeving, more than ſuch as go before Faith; yet hee oftentimes uſeth the other, and tells men, they are not humbled enough, not broken enough; before they were humbled, then any thing would ſerve the turn to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and fit them for Mercy; and now they are humbled, hee tells them, they are never humbled enough.</p>
                  <p>Before, a ſigh in a good mood was enough to qualifie them for Mercy, and the Promiſe. Now ſighs, groans, tears, daily break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under the burthen of ſin is all nothing, all is too little.</p>
                  <p>Indeed hee fain would have thee to lye in Hell, and ſtay there, or if hee doth not object againſt thy ſoul the want of humiliation. Why then hee will tell thee, thou wants Faith; if thou had'ſt Faith, then thou might go over to the promiſe, but thou wants Faith; and what doth hee mean by that, why that is, thou wants aſſurance; hee would put men to aſſurance, before they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; hee would put them to the evidence, Chriſt is their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, before hee ſuffer them to reſt upon Chriſt as a Saviour. Or if not this; yet hee will tell thee, thou want'ſt ſuch and ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before thou can beleeve; hee would fain have men either to bring ſomething of their own to the Promiſe, or hee would have men to expect theſe things before they go to the Promiſe, when indeed theſe things follow upon the ſouls cloſing with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth Satan keep many poor ſouls in a hoodwinkt condition, and hinders them from going over to Chriſt and the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>And that is the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond ground why men are ſo ſlow to beleeve, and that is taken from themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It doth ariſe from their ignorance, they know not the tenor of the Covenant, the tearms of Mercy. Men brought out of a ſinfull condition, once awakened to ſee their ſins, can think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but working themſelves to life, licking themſelves whole, therefore they fall upon prayers, duties (as I have ſometimes told you) as ſo many bribes for a pardon, as ſo many pennies
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97371:148"/> laid out for the purchaſe of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Wee run naturally to the Covenant of works, but wee muſt bee drawn before wee can go to the Covenant of Grace. <hi>No man can come except, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 6.44. A convinced man runs to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, but hee muſt bee a converted man, that goes tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth ariſe from our pride often, that wee will not take Mercy gratis, wee will not deny our ſelves, and cloſe with Mercy as God tenders it.</p>
                  <p>You have a ſtrange phraſe in <hi>Rom,</hi> 10.3. <hi>they would not ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs of Faith;</hi> here are proud hearts indeed, that it ſhould bee matter of ſubmiſſion for a condemned man to take a pardon, a wounded man to take a plaiſter, a ſick man a cordiall, a naked man cloathing, a loſt ſinner a Saviour. One would think this is ſtrange, that it ſhould bee a matter of ſubmiſſion to accept of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to bee ſaved.</p>
                  <p>But wee like well of the Spiders motto, <hi>mihi ſolo debeo;</hi> I owe all to my ſelf, and would bee content to climb to Heaven by a thread of our own ſpinning.</p>
                  <p>God is willing to give, and wee would deſerve, hee would have all of Grace, and wee would have all of debt. Wee would fain bring our penny to the Promiſe; yea when wee are nothing, wee would bring our own nothingneſs. So hard it is to make a ſoul empty, and when that is done to bring that empty ſoul over to the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third ground from our ſelves, which makes men humbled ſo ſlow to beleeve. It may bee too much tenderneſs, they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of abuſing Gods Juſtice in their cloſes with his Mercie; Oh ſay they! I am affraid of preſuming of Mercy. It was their fault before to preſume the fear of it, their fault now. I ſay to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of Mercy was their fault before, and the fear of preſuming is their fault now.</p>
                  <p>One would think this to carry a fair forehead, they dare not beleeve ſay they, and why ſo? becauſe they are affraid to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; is not this a good pretence?</p>
                  <p>But ah! here is the Prince of darkneſs, like the Angel of light; let us examine it, thou ſayeſt thou dareſt not beleeve, becauſe thou art affraid to preſume. And why doſt thou fear to preſume?</p>
                  <p>It is preſumption to beleeve Mercy, and yet continue in a way of ſin; and it is preſumption to expect Mercy in a way of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but it is no preſumption to beleeve. Why doſt thou fear thou ſhalt preſume? thou canſt not ſay, thou takes that which doth not belong to thee, for it belongs to whoever can take it: But it may bee thou ſayeſt thou art not fitted for Mercy, thou art then fit for Mercy, when thou art made willing to cloſe with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the tearms of Mercy, that is to take Mercy, as to render up thy ſelf to duty, as to give up thy ſelf to obey.</p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:97371:148"/>
                  <p>But thou ſayeſt thou ſhalt preſume, for thou art not worthy of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>And wouldeſt thou bee worthy of Mercy? doſt thou know what thou ſayeſt? wouldeſt thou deſerve Mercy? where then were Grace? This overthrows the Covenant of Grace? it cannot bee a Covenant of Grace, if there ſhould bee any thing of thy bringing, which is not of Gods beſtowing.</p>
                  <p>May wee not ſay to thee truly what <hi>Eliab, Davids</hi> Brother falſely ſaid to him, when hee told him hee came out for Gods Glory. Hee tells him no, it was the pride of his heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28. So thou pretends Gods Glory, thou ſayeſt becauſe thou wouldeſt not wrong Gods Juſtice, and make Gods Mercy a ſinfull mercy, therefore thou doeſt not beleeve; but take heed it bee not the pride of thy heart.</p>
                  <p>If the time would permit, I would put ſomething to thee. 1. By way of Queſtion. 2. By way of Suppoſal.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which I ſhould have put to thee by way of queſtion ſhould have been. 1. Couldſt thou not have beleeved God would bee mercifull unto thee, if thou wert not ſo ſinfull? 2. If thou wert more humble, if thou hadſt more Grace, couldſt thou not bee content to pennance thy ſelf for a time, for thy former ſin; were not this good, and what were this but to make thy humiliation a ſtep to Mercy, to a pardon?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which I would put by way of ſuppoſal. Suppoſe thou hadſt been a Traytor, and thy Prince ſhould offer thee a pardon for all thy treaſon, upon condition of acceptance, and rendring up thy ſelf to him for ſervice. And thou ſhouldeſt refuſe a pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art a Rebel or Traitor, or becauſe thou doubt'ſt of the truth and reality of thy Princes tender? or elſe becauſe thou thinkeſt thou art not able to do him ſervice for future, therefore wilt not accept of a pardon for preſent; what ſhould wee think of this? Or ſuppoſe a Creditor ſhould tell thee, if thou wouldeſt but bring thy books, come to him, and reckon with him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thy debt, hee would pardon thy debt. And the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould now refuſe to come.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either becauſe hee is not able to pay. 2. Or becauſe hee thinks hee ſhall bee able to diſcharge all himſelf in time. 3. Or elſe becauſe hee doubts of the truth of his intention, in ſtead of bringing him to reckon that hee might pardon him; hee intends to arreſt him, and caſt him into priſon. Is not here a great deal of pride, and unbeleef, and wronging of love?</p>
                  <p>And how ſhall wee interpret this ſtanding off? is not the caſe alike. God tenders mercy to thee, as a Prince, a pardon, and thou refuſeſt, why? either thou beleeveſt not the truth of this, that God offers pardon upon beleeving, or elſe thou thinks to deſerve thine own pardon.</p>
                  <p>So God offers thee an acquittance, if thou wilt bring thy book,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97371:149"/> and come and reckon with him, confeſs ſin, acknowledge Mercy; but thou commeſt not, and what is the reaſon? either thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt not the truth of this; this is too good news to bee true; thou thinkeſt it is but to take advantage againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>You think when you go to God in confeſſion, you go as a debtor into the hands of a hard Creditor, who doth but wait to arreſt him. You cannot beleeve the truth of this offer, or elſe you think you ſhall bee able to pay your own debt in time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another ground from our ſelves, why wee are ſo <hi>ſlow to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;</hi> is, that wee doubt of Gods will, wee doubt whether God will have mercy on us, yea or no.</p>
                  <p>It is with us as with a Prince or Creditor, as before: were wee but well ſetled in the Major of the Goſpel, in theſe truths.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God ſent his Son for this end, into the World to ſave poor ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That Chriſt was able to ſave to the utmoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>And that Chriſt was as willing as hee is powerfull; wee ſhould not bee ſo ſlow of heart to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Brethren, what can God do more to perſwade you of his willingneſs? nay more, what could Chriſt do more than is done?</p>
                  <p>Will you go by his revealed will? and that you ſhall bee judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by at the laſt day, why there you ſee nothing but willingneſs of God and Chriſt to accept of them who come.</p>
                  <p>If you ſhould go by the revealed will of man, you may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they may ſpeak one thing and intend another.</p>
                  <p>But if you go by the revealed will of God, you cannot miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe Gods heart is really the ſame that his word is, hee ſpeaks not a ſyllable more than hee will make good.</p>
                  <p>Men ſpeak often more than their hearts, or they may ſpeak contrary to their hearts, but God doth not, hee really intends what hee ſpeaks</p>
                  <p>And his revealed will tells thee, that hee would have thee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by comming, &amp;c. that if thou wilt beleeve, thou ſhalt bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. That if thou confeſs, &amp;c. therefore no cauſe to doubt of Gods will.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth ground of our <hi>ſlowneſs to beleeve.</hi> It may bee you finde ſome reſt to your ſouls on this ſide Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It may bee you have been troubled for ſin, have been in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of conſcience, and you have prayed, you have mourned, and thereupon have gotten ſome peace, and quiet in your ſouls, and you ſeek no further.</p>
                  <p>This is to lick your ſelves whole.</p>
                  <p>And how often, how ordinarily doth theſe things ſtand between us and Chriſt, between us and the Promiſe; if wee found no peace nor ſatisfaction in theſe, then wee ſhould go over to Chriſt, but finding this on this ſide Chriſt, therefore are wee <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:97371:149"/>
                  <p>Now to take away this, you muſt know that that peace which is not ſetled upon the heart by a promiſe, by beleeving; that peace will never do you good, a true trouble were better.</p>
                  <p>It is not works, but Chriſt, not praying, but beleeving, not the Law, but the Goſpel; Chriſt the Promiſe, that brings true peace into the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the other may give a man ſome eaſe for the time, but this will never work a ſound and ſubſtantial peace.</p>
                  <p>You read in the Wilderneſs there was no plaiſter for the ſtung <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> but looking up to the brazen Serpent.</p>
                  <p>So there is no remedy for a ſtung ſinner, of which the former was a type, both in the malady, and in the remedy, but looking up unto Chriſt, beleeving in him.</p>
                  <p>And you ſee how Chriſt doth parallel them in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>As Moſes lift up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the ſtung <hi>Iſraelite</hi> had made a confection of the beſt herbs in the Wilderneſs; a plaiſter of all the ſoveraign ingredients in the World, and applied with it Mountains of Prayers, Seas of tears; yet this would not have helped him, if with all he had not looked upon the brazen Serpent.</p>
                  <p>God had ſet up that way, and nothing elſe ſhould do the cure. So let the ſtung ſinner make what plaiſter hee will of duty, of prayers, for the ſalving of conſcience, the healing of the wound, yet if hee do not look up, beleeve never, healed never.</p>
                  <p>I grant it (to prevent an objection) that theſe duties may do ſomething for the ſtay of a mans ſpirit, and the quieting of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for a time, becauſe being ſuch things as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and in Gods way, they may have ſome influence into a mans conſcience, for the quieting and ſtilling of it for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are all too ſhort to bring a ſound and ſubſtantial peace into the ſoul; it is not working, but beleeving, not duty, but Chriſt that muſt do that.</p>
                  <p>If God had intended this for thy cure, if theſe had been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, what need had hee to have ſent Chriſt into the World? what need had Chriſt to have dyed and ſhed his bloud? God might have given man ability to have performed duty, and all had then been done.</p>
                  <p>But the ſending of Chriſt into the World, and the ſhedding of his bloud, ſhews it was a greater work to redeem ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Indeed theſe things are ſubſervient to the plaiſter, to the cure; but theſe things are not the plaiſter, not the cure.</p>
                  <p>By Prayer wee ſeek and beg for a plaiſter in a wounded condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by Prayer wee praiſe God when the plaiſter hath been applied, but this is not the cure, this is not the plaiſter, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended that.</p>
                  <p>So by hearing wee have diſcovered to us where the plaiſter is to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97371:150"/> bee had, and by hearing afterward, wee do but diſcover our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to know more of Gods will, that wee might obey him, but this is not the plaiſter.</p>
                  <p>So by works and obedience before healing, wee do but carry our ſelves in ſuch a deportment and demeanure, as they ſhould do, who wait for ſuch a mercy from God; and by works and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence afterwards wee do but declare our thankfulneſs to God when the cure is wrought, but this is not the cure, being juſtified wee work, wee do not work that wee may bee juſtified.</p>
                  <p>And therefore though you ſhould get ſome obvious refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the performance of duties in the purſuit of Chriſt, yet let not this ſlacken, but quicken you in your way; bee thankfull for it, quickened by it, and ſtill remember to ariſe, this is not your reſt.</p>
                  <p>Hee who reſts on this ſide Chriſt, will reſt on this ſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. All your duties will bee but ropes of ſand, like chains of glaſs, too brickle to draw your ſouls to Heaven. Though natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſcience may get ſome ſatisfaction from theſe ſprings, the performance of duties, yet theſe are too ſhallow to ſatisfie the thirſt of a gracious heart.</p>
                  <p>They are neither full, nor are they pure, nor are they perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and laſting ſprings. As I might ſhew you; not full, becauſe wrought out of our ſelves, not pure, becauſe mingled with our imperfections, muddy ſprings; our juſtifying righteouſneſs is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but our ſanctifying righteouſneſs is imperfect, nor are they conſtant. Drought will come, the time will come, when theſe will bee too ſhort to reach comfort into thy ſoul, that if God lead thee not to a ſpring, at laſt thou art undone.</p>
                  <p>The Brook <hi>Cherith</hi> did ſupply <hi>Elijah</hi> for a time, but at laſt it dryed up, and could afford him no Water, and had not God brought him then unto a ſpring hee had periſhed.</p>
                  <p>So there are many, who lye a long time by the ſprings of duty, the ſtreams of performances, and they get ſome refreſhment there which keep them off from going to Chriſt; but the time will come that theſe waters will fail, and if then thou haſt not a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a Chriſt to go to, thou wilt periſh for all this.</p>
                  <p>Where on the contrary, here in the greateſt drought thou ſhalt finde waters enough, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.7, 8. <hi>Bleſſed is the man who truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is, for hee ſhall bee as a tree plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by waters, and ſhall not ſee when drought commeth; his leaf ſhall bee green, and hee ſhall not bee carefull in the years of drought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Years of drought hee ſhall never ſee, never bee ſenſible when heat commeth; <hi>his leaf ſhall bee green.</hi> And thus much for the ſecond ground, why wee are ſo <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>I told you the laſt day, that wee look upon the beſt of others, and the worſt of our ſelves; upon the beſt, not the worſt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                  <p>Beſides, though Princes may pardon former treaſon, yet they cannot change the traiterous heart, nor can they inable them, for the future to bee loyal and obedient. But now God can, with the pardon of ſin, hee can and doth change the heart of the ſinner, hee ſends him away with another heart, with the forgiveneſs of former diſobedience, hee gives ſtrength and ability to obey for future; and therefore why ſhould either preſent ſenſe of ſin and imperfection, or the apprehenſion of the want of future ability, keep us off from cloſing with Chriſt and the Promiſe; ſeeing by this the ſin is pardoned, the nature is healed, and the ſoul inabled to future ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the way to do him ſervice is to come in, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As wee look upon others heights, ſo wee look upon others depths, and by that keep off from the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>It may bee, wee ſee and hear of others of the Saints who have been exerciſed with great troubles, terrors, legal breakings, &amp;c. and have been in ſad conditions, it may bee, for many months, nay years, and thou reflecteſt upon thy ſelf, and ſeeſt thou was never thus humbled, thou never had experience of ſuch legal breakings, either none at all, or not in that meaſure which others have had; and thereupon thou concludeſt certainly the Promiſe doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to mee.</p>
                  <p>And this is another ground which prevails with many, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now to take off this in a few words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why ſhould anothers humiliation bee a pattern for thee? when it may bee that which inlarged his troubles were,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some outward croſs and affliction which was joyned to his inward trouble; as when the fountains from below, and windows from above were opened, there was a great flood, a deluge.</p>
                  <p>So when afflictions from beneath, and troubles from above concurre, this is a deluge of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or may bee that which inlarged another mans trouble, was ſome horrible temptations, injections of Satan, blaſphemous bloudy thoughts, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or may bee ſome bodily diſtemper, the predominancy of ſome humour, as melancholly, which gives edge and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to terrors, and ſpiritual troubles.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Or may bee his ignorance, in the Covenant of Grace, the tearms of Mercy.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:97371:151"/>5. Or may bee the long concealing of his trouble; as you ſee <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 32.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Or may bee giving credit to the lying ſuggeſtions of Satan.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Or may bee his pride, his unbelief, jealouſy, frowardneſs of ſpirit, as it is with ſuch as will nouriſh themſelves in a needleſſe bondage, and will not hearken after comfort, making their chains heavier than God hath made them; who will not ſuffer a thought of hope or comfort to enter through the anguiſh of their bondage. Like the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 6.9. God ſent them delivery, but they looked not after it, through the extreamity of their bondage. And is there any reaſon then, that others humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould bee a pattern to thee. Thou mighteſt as well deſire part of their croſs, which yet thou wouldſt not do, for a great part of many mens humiliations, is either their ſin, or their croſs, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why ſhould other mens humiliations bee a pattern for thee; when yet God doth not require the ſame meaſure, nor is the ſame meaſure alike neceſſary to all, neither in reſpect of God, or of men?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not in reſpect of man: ſome need not ſo much as others.</p>
                  <p>As ſome mens fleſh is harder to heal than others, ſo ſome mens hearts. A Needle may do that to one, which a lance will not do to another. A frown to one, which blows will not do to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Some men are of crabbed and untoward ſpirits, and knotty blocks had need of hard wedges.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some men have longer ſcores, greater reckonings, have been greater ſinners than others, and though not ever, yet ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily God doth proportion the ſorrow to the ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some men of greater parts, of greater places, who are not ſo eaſily humbled, many things may bee in the ſubject, which may vary the caſe.</p>
                  <p>And as the ſame meaſure is not neceſſary in reſpect of man, ſo the ſame is not neceſſary in reſpect of God, his ends are various.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some men hee intends to beſtow greater meaſure of grace upon, than upon others, and hee layes a proportionable foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some hee intends to uſe as one of a thouſand, to comfort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; therefore hee doth exerciſe them with difficulties, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, eclipſes of his favour, with temptations, injections of Satan, decayes, relapſes, that they may bee experimentally able to ſettle and comfort others 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some hee intends for great ſervices, great imployments, to make them Champions in his cauſe. And therefore hee doth humble them the more at their bringing in. As you ſee <hi>Paul, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Auguſtine.</hi> All Gods people are Souldiers, but few are Champions, ſome hee hath for lighter skirmiſhes, and leſs humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation will ſerve their turn to prepare them for them.</p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:97371:152"/>
                  <p>But ſuch as hee intends for the main battle, to bee Champions in his cauſe, hee doth uſually exerciſe with greater difficulties, that ſo they might not ſtart aſide in the day of tryal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some hee intends to bee patterns and examples of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the world, and therefore carries them on with troubles of ſpirit, and lets them lye longer in them, that being raiſed up, they may bee dead to the World ever after.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the like meaſures are not neceſſary, neither inre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods ends, nor in reſpect of your ſelves; and why then ſhould any mans humiliation bee a pattern for thee?</p>
                  <p>All that can bee ſaid in it is this, that ſo much is required, as to caſt us out of our ſelves, make us weary of our ſins, willing to ſell all; cut off right hands, pull out right eyes, to part with the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and beloved ſins for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Wee all agree, it is ſufficient when it doth caſt a man out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and bring him over to Chriſt; and how much that is who can ſet down?</p>
                  <p>A leſs degree will do that in one, which it will not in another; if the ſame meaſures were alike neceſſary for all, then it would follow,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That every one is ſo to labour to come to that meaſure, as to receive no comfort in the Promiſe till hee have attained it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And it would follow, that what comfort any may have gotten in the Promiſe, they are to yeeld up, if they have not had the like meaſures that others have attained to; and what perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, fears, doubts, would ſo bee left in the conſciences of men, ſo that they would never finde a bottome to ſtand on.</p>
                  <p>As in Grace, a man would never have comfort, if his comfort were to ariſe from the meaſures, and not from the truth. So in humiliation, many poor ſouls in taking others for a pattern, have loſt the rule, and put themſelves into a greater in capacity to cloſe with the Promiſe, at a greater diſtance from Chriſt than they were before; and have made themſelves miſerable for the preſent, and for the future, and ſo have gone drooping even to their graves. And it had been better for many ſpeakers and hearers too; if this Doctrin had been preſſed more before. How many have had their heads broken in peeces with it, and it is eaſier for theſe troubles to break the head, than to break the heart.</p>
                  <p>But thus much for the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee wee have finiſhed the two generals. That <hi>wee are ſlow of heart to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What are the grounds that men are <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wee come to the next, what are the reaſons that this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſpirit is ſo offenſive unto God? I have given you many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in my Sabbath dayes diſcourſe on the third of <hi>John.</hi> Why God was ſo ſevere againſt unbeleef.</p>
                  <p>All which would ſerve as ſo many demonſtrations of this point,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97371:152"/> wee will at this time adde but theſe three more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Slowneſs of heart to beleeve,</hi> is a temper very offenſive to God, becauſe it argues and ſpeaks a corrupt heart.</p>
                  <p>A heart byaſſed with other reſpects which hinders from cloſing with Chriſt. As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can you beleeve when you ſeek honour;</hi> when you are byaſſed with ſuch reſpects as theſe?</p>
                  <p>Such a ſpirit, either it argues ignorance, or pride, or love of ſin, or jealouſy of the truth of God, the goodneſs of God, and this is very offenſive; jealouſy is the rage of a man, &amp;c. which is more provoking, becauſe God hath ſo far condeſcended to our weakneſs for our eſtabliſhment, that hee hath not only given us his Promiſe, his Covenant, his Oath and Seal; and all to comfort us. And if notwithſtanding all this, wee ſhall nouriſh a ſpirit of jealouſy, and cheriſh our doubts and diſtruſts; this muſt needs bee very diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God. <hi>Vae nobis ſi nec juranti Deo credimus. Aug.</hi> If a man ſhould give you his Promiſe, and yet to ſatisfie you to his Promiſe, hee ſhould annex his Oath, and to his Oath his Seal, &amp;c. If yet notwithſtanding you will bee jealous and diſtruſt him, how would this make a mans bloud to riſe? how would hee break forth into rage? what, will you not beleeve mee? do you think mee to bee a Devil? do you think I will bee perjured? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And how much more muſt this provoke God, who is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably true of his word. One ſyllable being a better bottome for a ſoul to reſt upon, than all the Proteſtations of men and Angels; men though true, Angels though true, yet they are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves immutably true, becauſe they are but Creatures, but now God is, hee is truth it ſelf; no ſhadow of change in him.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and not only true, but able to make good his Word, what hee hath promiſed. Men may bee true, and yet want ability to perform, but what God hath ſaid; hee will do, becauſe hee is faithfull, and hee is able to do, becauſe almighty.</p>
                  <p>And hath God condeſcended to us ſo far, as not only to give us his Promiſe, his Oath, Covenant and Seal; and are wee yet <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve?</hi> do wee yet nouriſh jealouſies and diſtruſts? Why then judge if this muſt not needs bee a high provocation of God.</p>
                  <p>And that is the firſt reaſon, becauſe this ſin ſpeaks corruption of heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe ſuch a ſpirit what in it lyes, makes void and null the great things of God, I ſay as much as in thee lyes, for thou canſt not do it. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God is faithfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men beleeve, or beleeve not:</hi> ſo God is mercifull, powerfull, wiſe, gracious, true, whether men will beleeve, or beleeve not.</p>
                  <p>But this I ſay, as much as in thee lies, thou makeſt void all the great and ſtupendious things of God, wee will name theſe ſeven.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:97371:153"/>1. Thou makeſt void the great councels of God, all the thoughts of his wiſdome in contriving ſuch a way, to advance his glory in the ſalvation of men. God had purpoſed and contrived from everlaſting to make himſelf glorious, to ſet up and advance the glory of his wiſdome and grace, and this is the way his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome pitched upon from everlaſting, to do all this by ſending of Chriſt into the World, and thou by ſtanding out, doſt not only fruſtrate Gods ends in thy ſalvation, but as much as in thee lyes, nulleſt and makeſt void all the thoughts and contrivings of his wiſdome; for all this is to no purpoſe, while thou ſtands out and wilt not beleeve.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou makeſt void all the thoughts of his Mercy, in which he deſired to ſet forth himſelf, and make himſelf viſible to the loſt ſons of men, by ſending of Chriſt into the World.</p>
                  <p>But now if thou wilt not beleeve, to what purpoſe were all theſe great things of God, to what purpoſe was all this glorious fabrick of Gods mercy and councel, which was the greateſt thing that ever came upon his heart? Gods maſter-peece, which went to the height of his skill and wiſdome, to the height of his mercy and love. Beyond which there is a <hi>non ultra</hi> in Gods thoughts, there was no further or more, God could go no higher than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all was infinite; but thou in ſtanding off doſt annul, and make void all the thoughts of his mercy, and his love, if others ſhould do the like, to what purpoſe then were all? it would make all this void, and to no purpoſe: thou doſt it as much as in thee lyeſt. If a man ſhould make a curious peece that ſhould publiſh his skill, his greatneſs, wiſdome, and a man come and break it all in peeces, would hee not bee greatly offended? And what a fearfull thing is it, to make void that wherein God ſet himſelf, to make himſelf glorious? to obſcure that in which God ſet himſelf, to make himſelf viſible in? but thou, who art <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve</hi> (as far as it lyes in thee) doſt this, and therefore what a provocation of God muſt this bee?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou doſt as much as in thee lyes, make void all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Gods mercy to thee. The great end which God aimed at in this great work of ſending Chriſt into the World, was that thou mighteſt beleeve in him, and live. Now if thou ſtand out, and will not come in, will not cloſe with him, thou doſt what lyes in thee, to make void all the purpoſes of God to thee for good. I ſay, what lyes in thee, for thou ſhalt never do it; the election ſhall bring thee in; Gods purpoſe ſhall bring thee to his Promiſe. Our ſins may alter Gods conditional purpoſes of temporal mercies; as hee tells them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>I ſaid indeed, that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy Fathers ſhould walk before mee for ever, but now ſaith the Lord, bee it far from mee, for they that honour mee, I will honour, &amp;c.</hi> But thou ſhalt never bee able to make void Gods eternal purpoſes of good to thee; but yet take heed of tempting God, provoking
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:97371:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> God; God may make thy body ſmart for it, though he ſave thy ſoul at laſt; make thee know better, not try concluſions. But I ſay, what lyes in thee thou doſt diſanul all the purpoſes of God to thee for good, which is a fearful thing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thou doſt what lyes in thee, fruſtrate the expectation of God. You know it is a great affliction to a man to have his expectation fruſtrated, and the greater the good which was expected, the greater the cut and wound to be diſappointed and fruſtrated. Why I ſay (may I ſpeak after the manner of men) thou doſt what lyes in thee, to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all the expectations of God. Why, what were Gods expectations? but that thou ſhouldeſt receive his Son, if hee ſent him; that thou ſhouldeſt imbrace Chriſt, beleeve in him. And this ſeems to be ſweetly inſinuated in the parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.37. <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Surely they will reverence my Son,</hi> though they had abuſed the Prophets, &amp;c. yet <hi>ſurely they will reverence my Son;</hi> they owe ſo much homage to mee, or they will look upon him ſo great a perſon, the Son of God; <hi>Surely they will reverence my Son.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Perſon and Parentage ſhould not procure reverence, yet the ſervice he came about will be a grateful ſervice; hee comes to be Saviour, hee comes to redeem them from Hell. Certainly hee will bee a welcome gueſt to them; Oh how willing will they be to receive him? how glad to entertain him? with what open armes will they imbrace him? how ready to obey him? <hi>Surely they will reverence my Son.</hi> And in reaſon who would not have thought ſo? what welcome might not the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expect, the Prince expect, who came upon ſuch a buſineſs? What might not a Prince expect, who came to looſen the captives, to redeem vaſſals, to relieve diſtreſſed, break chains? Sure in all reaſon hee ſhould have been received with all joy, with all acclamations and willing imbraces: This God expected. But now when in ſtead of receiving, we reject Chriſt, ſleight Chriſt, undervalue Chriſt, when we will not cloſe with him, &amp;c. how doth this croſs the expectation, and fruſtrate it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We do what lyes in us to make void Gods end in ſending Chriſt. What was the end which God aimed at in this plot, in contriving ſuch a way, in ſending Chriſt into the World? this was his end, that we might beleeve and live, his glory, in our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Surely the end muſt needs be glorious, when the means and work was ſo glorious; if the foundation of this work were ſo glorious, what will the whole ſtructure bee? Now this was one part of Gods end in ſending of Chriſt, that thou ſhouldeſt receive Chriſt, beleeve in him. And ſo long as thou ſtandeſt out, thou croſſeſt Gods end, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the end of God. And this muſt needs be a great provocation of God. If a man did take a great deal of pains in a work; ſpent all his time and indeavours for ſome end, and at laſt be croſſed in the end; the work is nothing to him. This provokes, &amp;c. Why thou doſt fruſtrate Gods end?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thou doſt as much as in thee lyes, make void the death of Chriſt, thou makeſt all his ſufferings, and all his blood ſhed to be to no purpoſe. What was the end that Chriſt ſhed his blood? what was the end Chriſt dyed? why it was no other but this, that we might beleeve in him, and have a pardon? &amp;c. But now ſo long as thou ſtandeſt out, thou fruſtrateſt all this; if all were like thee, I pray thee, to what purpoſe were the death of Chriſt, the expence and ſhedding of his blood? And therefore this provokes much; if one of us ſhould ſuffer much for the obtaining of ſuch an end, if after hee had indured, to bee diſappointed of it, this much provokes us.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thou doſt as much as in thee lyes, make void all the Promiſes of God to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>God promiſed and entred into Covenant with Chriſt; that if hee would lay down his life and blood, hee would make him King over Saints; hee would give the Heathen for his inheritance, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>Hee ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and bee ſatisfied.</hi> God promiſed Chriſt, that if hee would lay down his life for a people, hee ſhould have them; hee would give a people to him. And thy ſtanding out doth what lyes in thee, to make this Promiſe void, to make God a lyar to his Son, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt not bee able. Chriſt ſhall have a people, God will yet ſet his King, &amp;c.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97371:154"/> yet if all were like thee, where were Chriſts people?</p>
                  <p>Nay, and thou robbeſt Chriſt of the reward and fruit of all his death and ſufferings, this was the reward Chriſt was to have for his death, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If a man had ſweat, or ſhed his bloud for ſuch a thing, you would not bee ſo injurious to him, as to hinder him of the fruit of it, every one would bee ready to cry out, of ſuch an act of injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Why, thou art Chriſts reward, hee ſhed his bloud, laid down his life for this end, for this purpoſe. And by thy ſtanding out, thou doſt what is in thee to rob Chriſt of this his reward, the fruit of his death, and therefore what a provocation is it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe this temper keeps a man in an unſerviceable condition, both to God and man. And this muſt needs bee very offenſive to God.</p>
                  <p>It was one great end, that God ſent Chriſt into the World for, that wee might bee able to do him ſervice; it was the end of our Creation, and of our redemption too, that being redeemed out of the hands of our enemies wee ſhould ſerve him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75.</p>
                  <p>Though our ſervice was not the impulſive cauſe of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming us, though it was not the motive, which did perſwade and prevail with God to ſend Chriſt into the World, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us, yet this was an end, one main end which God aimed at in ſending Chriſt into the World, that wee might bee able to ſerve him without fear, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt did not diſcharge us from the debt of ſin, to free us from the debt of ſervice; but therefore did hee pay the one, that wee might bee able to return the other. As the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. where having ſhewed that wee are juſtified, and our ſins pardoned, hee concludes, <hi>therefore Brethren, wee are debters not to the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt hath broken the bands of ſubjection to others, that wee might take upon us the yoak of ſervice to him.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt freed us from the curſe of the Law, that wee might yeeld obedience to the Commands of the Law; from the penalties, that wee might obey the Precepts; from the Law, as a Covenant, that we might walk in obedience to the Law as a Rule. <hi>Plane dicimus deceſsiſſe legem quod onera, &amp;c.</hi> That as the Law was given with Evangelical purpoſes, ſo it might now bee kept of us with Evangelical principles.</p>
                  <p>So that this was one main end that God aimed at in our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that wee might bee able to do him ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore that which croſſeth this great end which God aimed at, and keeps us in an unſerviceable condition to God, muſt needs bee very offenſive to God,</p>
                  <p>But that unbeleeving doth. It makes you utterly unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God.</p>

Many men think they can do God better ſervice by doubting, than by beleeving; by ſtanding off, than by comming in.</p>
                  <p>But alas! Satan deludes thee, if hee get between thee and the Promiſe, if hee keep thee off from Chriſt, hee will either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten thee from obedience, or hee will diſcourage and diſable thee in thy obedience.

                  <p>Should they beleeve, this were to preſume, to ſin againſt Gods Juſtice in the cloſes with his Mercy, this were to give holy things to dogs, &amp;c. Satan preſents ſin.</p>
                  <p>And ſome there are ſo witty, as to object againſt all that can be brought; as if they took a pride to argue themſelves into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of miſery, ſetting the pride of their own carnal reaſonings, againſt the riches and freeneſs of the mercy of God; if you bring a promiſe to them, when caſt down for ſin, and indeavour to faſten a promiſe on them, they can tell you, that this is not the meaning of the Promiſe, or certainly this Promiſe doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to mee.</p>

                  <p>Thus doth many a poor ſoul take pains to reaſon himſelf into miſery, and ſide with Satan, and take part with the corruptions, and unbeleevings of his own heart againſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And what will bee the end of it? ſure it will breed bitterneſs in the latter end; for the preſent, it is thy ſin, and for the future, it will bee thy miſery; either it will cauſe God to withdraw himſelf from thee, as hee tells them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.20.

                  <p>When the workings of natural conſcience are done; when fears are allayed, when troubles are blown over, then will all ſervice bee done too; if not, yet the continuance of troubles, and fears, will make you caſt of all, and ſay, there is no hope; or will diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage your hearts in your walking, that your life will bee little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a martyrdome, with continual racks and troubles.

                  <p>Thus is miſerable Unbeleef, a fruit of ſinful Unbeleef; which the more miſerable, the leſſe ſinful; the more ſeen, the more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for; the more lamented and mourned for, the leſſe ſinful; while it was your ſin it was not ſeen, it was not ſorrowed for, and now it is, &amp;c. and the more miſery, the leſſe your ſin in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

                  <p n="1">1. Bee yee convinced of the greatneſſe of the ſin, it is a ſin whereby you wrong God, gratifie Satan, wrong your own ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You wrong God in it, you obſcure his glory, you limit his power, you contemn his wiſdome, you give a lye to his truth, you abuſe his love, you ſleight and reject all the precious, and peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoughts of his Mercy and Grace.</p>
                  <p>I told you not long ſince, that God was more ſevere againſt Unbeleef than any ſin, becauſe Unbeleef was moſt ſevere to God. No ſin was more cruel to God, God hath no greater enemy in the World than Unbeleef. It is an enemy to whatever is moſt dear and precious unto God. Therefore is hee ſuch an enemy to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef; if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You gratifie Satan. I beleeve thou wouldſt not willingly (if thou knew it) gratifie Satan for a World.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee in thy ſtanding off, thou doſt not only gratifie him, but thou canſt do Satan no greater a pleaſure, no greater a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy in the World.</p>
                  <p>In this Satan hath all his deſire of thee, that which hee deſires is to make void all the great things of God, that which hee deſires, is to make the death of Chriſt in vain; to make the bloud of Chriſt to bee ſhed in vain, to make the great counſel of God, the great things of his wiſdome and mercy to no purpoſe in the World;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:97371:156"/> And by this ſtanding off thou doſt what lyes in thee to anſwer his deſire, and therefore this muſt needs glad him.</p>
                  <p>Beſides Satan knows full well, if hee do not wound thy Faith, thy Faith will wound him, break the head of the Serpent; and therefore it is that which hee laboureth after in all his temptations, if hee cannot keep thee from beleeving, yet to wound and weaken thy Faith, that thou mayeſt not wound him.</p>
                  <p>If hee cannot make thee his friend, yet if hee can weaken his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. If hee cannot take away thy weapon, yet if hee can weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thy arm, or blunt thy weapon, hee is content.</p>
                  <p>If hee cannot deſtroy thy Faith, yet if hee can weaken thy Faith, if not hurt thy Faith, yet if hee can keep thy Faith from hurting him, by weakening of it: for every act of Faith wounds Satan, bindes him in chains, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And therefore if hee can prevail to keep thee from beleeving, or if hee can weaken and wound thy Faith, hee is well contented, this gratifieth him.</p>
                  <p>What can gratifie him more, than to make a Pageant of all the great things of God, than to make all theſe great things like a dream?</p>
                  <p>What can gratifie him more, than to keep thy ſoul at a diſtance from Chriſt and the Promiſe; what can pleaſure him more, than to make a ſoul look upon God, as a God of terror and wrath?</p>
                  <p>What more, than to keep the ſoul upon racks, upon fears, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and diſquiets; this is ſome of his own ſpirit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Nay, what can gratifie him more, than to keep a ſoul in a dead unſerviceable condition, make a man unfit to live, unfit to dye, unfit for any ſervice to God and man?</p>
                  <p>Why, all this doth Satan do, if hee can but prevail to keep thy ſoul from Chriſt, at diſtance from the Promiſe, as I could ſhew you at large, &amp;c. The way Satan doth it, is by ſetting out ſin. Though I would bee willing to ſee ſin, yet I am not willing to ſee ſin in the Devils glaſs; I am not willing to ſee ſin, when Satan diſcovers ſin.</p>
                  <p>Satan hath two glaſſes, wherein hee diſcovers ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee hath a leſſening or extenuating glaſs, wherein hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers ſin to wicked men, which makes them appear leſs than they are; great ſins, ſmall ſins, infirmities; and leſſer ſins to bee no ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And Satan hath a multiplying or magnifying glaſs, wherein hee diſcovers ſin to them, when caſt down, and extends it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above the greatneſs of ſin, but of mercy alſo.</p>
                  <p>As I would have my eyes broad and open, to ſee ſin when God diſcovers it. So I would ſhut mine eyes when Satan diſcovers ſin.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall I know when God and when Satan diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:97371:157"/>1. When God diſcovers ſin, hee keeps up the apprehenſions of mercy above the greatneſs of ſin.</p>
                  <p>But when Satan diſcovers ſin, hee heightens ſin above the riches of mercy. As you ſee in Cain, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>my ſin is greater than can bee pardoned,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When God diſcovers ſin, he doth not bleere, but rather clear the eye of Faith to the beholding of Chriſt, hee makes the ſoul fitter to ſee Chriſt; doth not hinder, but helpeth the ſoul in ſight of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But when Satan diſcovers ſin, hee doth ever bleer and blinde the eye of Faith, from the beholding of Mercy; either hee diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the malady, and conceals the remedy, or hee holds the eye of Faith, that it cannot look upon Chriſt for mercy.</p>
                  <p>Hee puts the ſoul into a preſent incapacity to look up to God for mercy; hee ſtings, but holds not up the brazen Serpent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When God diſcovers ſin, it is to drive us out of our ſelves, and to draw us unto Chriſt and the Promiſe, makes the Law a Schoolmaſter, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. but Satans diſcoveries of ſin, ſets us further off from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When God diſcovers ſin, it is to make the ſoul more in love with Chriſt, to prize Chriſt more, to advance him more, to love him, and deſire him more. It is ſuch a diſcovery that makes the ſoul to run to the remedy.</p>
                  <p>But when Satan diſcovers ſin, it is to make us more affraid of Chriſt, to flye from Chriſt as <hi>Adam,</hi> never the more to deſire him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When God diſcovers ſin, hee humbles the ſoul under the ſight of it, hee makes a man to abhor himſelf, makes ſin hatefull to him.</p>
                  <p>But when Satan diſcovers ſin, it is to diſcourage us, not to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us: hee may make ſin fearful, but never makes it hateful.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, as you may know by the manner and the end of the diſcovery, whether Gods or no.</p>
                  <p>So by the time and temper wee are in.</p>
                  <p>Satan diſcovers ſin, when hee hath gotten the ſoul at an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; he comes upon us as <hi>Simeon</hi> upon the <hi>Shechemites</hi> when they were ſore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. when hee hath gotten the hill and the wind on us; when wee are in ſome ſad condition, when in temptation, when in darkneſs, when in ſome diſtreſſes, when wee are drawn from our ſuccours.</p>
                  <p>It is a paſſage of one, that Satan, when hee diſcovers ſin, and ſo hee openeth our wound; hee gets us into the wilderneſs, into the cold, from our friends, ſuccours, &amp;c. But when the Spirit of God openeth our wounds, it is by the fire, friends about us, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials near us, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But I think the difference is rather to bee taken from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the diſcovery, than from the end and effects of it.</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:97371:157"/>
                  <p>Well then, that is a ſinfull looking on ſin,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Which heightened ſin above the riches of mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which bleereth and blindeth the eye of Faith from behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Which ſets the ſoul at a farther diſtance from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Which makes the ſoul affraid of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Which diſcourageth the ſoul under ſight of it. And hee that thus looks upon ſin in Satans glaſs, no marvel if hee bee <hi>ſlow to beleeve;</hi> and to come over to the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When Satan diſcovers ſin, hee rather makes a malady, than diſcovers a malady, never diſcovereth one wound, but makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; never diſcovereth a ſin, but takes a courſe that that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſhall bee ſinfull.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, as you wrong God, and gratifie Satan, ſo you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure your own ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You rob your ſelves of comfort, and keep your ſelves in unneceſſary racks and troubles, and bondage. And this is a great evil. Nature cannot ſubſiſt without comfort; comfort is to the ſoul, what the ſoul is to the body; a man cannot live without it; and it puts grace to it too; though for a time Grace may live, and act ſtrongly in the want of comfort; yet when troubles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and a man walks long without comfort, it will put Grace to it, to the utmoſt to ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Oh what abundance of comfort, what floods of conſolation, what peace, what joy, doſt thou rob thy ſelf of in thy ſtanding off!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You hinder your ſouls of Grace.<note place="margin">Quantum cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus, tantum amamus.</note> Grace keeps a proportion with Faith. So much Faith, ſo much Grace, &amp;c. keep down Faith, and all Grace is kept down; and where Faith ſtirs, all the wheels move, its the ſpring of motion, the Maſter-wheel. Faith is the ſtomack which receives all for the nouriſhment of the whole. As all the members depend upon the ſtomack, ſo all the Graces upon Faith. It is a Mediatour to our Mediatour; it fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in proviſion to the ſoul, all depends upon it. If Grace be weak, Faith goes over to Chriſt, &amp;c. for the ſupply of ſtrength.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You make your ſelves every way unſerviceable to God; as I ſhewed you; you make your ſelves unable to do, unable to ſuffer for him. You make your ſelves good for nothing, unſerviceable to God, to the Church, to his cauſe, to your ſelves too, &amp;c. Many there are that think they can do God better ſervice in ſtanding off, than in comming in, by Fear, than by Faith.</p>
                  <p>They think that in nouriſhing their doubts, and their fears, they do cheriſh their care, watchfulneſs, humility.</p>
                  <p>And on the contrary, they think, that if once they ſhould come to beleeve, then they ſhould bee more looſe and careleſs, and take more liberty to themſelves. Indeed, you would have more liberty to ſervice, not to ſin. You would not bee tyed to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97371:158"/> ſervice with coards of fear, but with bands of love, your principle of ſervice, and your manner of ſervice would bee changed, where now you ſerve nim out of fear; then out of love, now out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of conſcience, then out of propenſions of a divine nature; now you ſerve him as ſlaves involuntarily, then as ſons with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs and delight, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now you do duty as a task, then as your trade. And you will walk in the wayes of duty, though you ſee no commings in.</p>
                  <p>As a man that loves his trade, that loves his calling, hee will hold it up, and follow it, though hee get nothing by it, though no gain or comming in by it. So the ſoul which hath a Principle bred in him ſuitable to the things of God, which is wrought by Faith, hee will hold up to pray and to do duty, though hee finde not commings in; there is a natural agreeableneſs between him and duty, between his ſpirit and the work, and though hee never get good by it, yet hee will hold up his ſpirit to the doing of it.</p>
                  <p>As it is with a man, whoſe nature is ſenſualized, that hath ſinned away the very common Principles, pluckt up the very ſenſes of nature, hee will drink, and bee drunk, though hee undo himſelf by it, though hee hurt his body, impoveriſh his eſtate, yet hee will drink, &amp;c. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>a Whore will bring a man to a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of bread,</hi> will undo a man, yet hee will go on in ſin, hee will not leave his ſin, though undone by it; hee will ſin, not only though hee get nothing, but though hee get hurt, though hee undo himſelf thereby, yet hee will go on in ſin, and the reaſon is, that univerſal ſutableneſs that is between his ſoul and ſin.</p>
                  <p>So on the other ſide, a godly man hee will ſerve God, hee will hold on in duty, in obedience, though hee finde no comming in by it.</p>
                  <p>There is ſuch a ſutableneſs between the ſpirit of a beleever, and the work, that though there is no commings in, though hee finde no peace, no comfort in the wayes of God, yet hee will hold up to the work.</p>
                  <p>Where now an unbeleever, if hee do not by theſe things get peace which is all hee looks after in the doing of it, if he do not get comfort, at laſt hee throws off all, becauſe there was no Principle of ſutableneſs to hold him to the duty.</p>
                  <p>Therefore you ſee how Satan deludes you. Faith alone is the ſpring of action, that which ſets us a work, and quicken us in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if Faith bee up, all his Graces will bee ſo too, and if that bee down, all other Graces are weak, and down with it.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> ſaith, it is the vertue of a Chriſtal, when the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of other precious ſtones are extinct, to raiſe them, and revive them again. So doth Faith with our Graces; when <hi>Davids</hi> heart was down in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.5. you ſee hee recovers himſelf by his Faith, no ſooner did hee exerciſe his Faith, but his heart is raiſed.</p>
                  <p>That which quickeneth you to ſervice, and inables you in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97371:158"/> is Faith, and that which deads your ſpirit, and makes you unſerviceable, is unbeleef, and therefore bee convinced of your ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bee humbled for it; this is the great ſin, the womb of ſin, the Mother and Nurſe of ſin, as I have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>That which holds up Satans Kingdome in you, is your unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef; if this fort were once taken, all the reſt would quickly yeeld up.</p>
                  <p>You ſee when Chriſt would conquer covetouſneſs, hee labours to conquer unbeleeving, as you ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25. to the end.</p>
                  <p>That being overcome, all the reſt yeeld up, and are vanquiſht. Nay it is a ſin which doth not only uphold particular ſins, but the ſtate of ſin. It is called a ſtate of unbeleef, wee do not ſay, a ſtate of drunkenneſſe, a ſtate of ſwearing, &amp;c. but a ſtate of unbeleef; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are but particular, this an univerſal ſin. And is there not then cauſe to bee humbled for it? you ſee what a ſin it is, how you wrong God, how you gratifie Satan, how you injure your ſelves; and is there not cauſe then to bee humbled for it?</p>
                  <p>Men are hard to bee humbled for this ſin, becauſe hard to bee convinced either that they are guilty of it, or that it is a ſin.</p>
                  <p>Prophane and wicked men, worldly men, they will not bee convinced that they do not beleeve. Though there bee nothing more plain, if the Devil did not delude them, for Faith and ſin cannot ſtand together; you can no more ſeparate Holineſs and Faith, than Light and the Sun.</p>
                  <p>And humbled men they are hard to bee convinced that it is a ſin.</p>
                  <p>Though it is eaſy to convince them that they do not beleeve, they are ſenſible enough of that, yet it is hard to perſwade them that it is a ſin, not to beleeve, that it is their duty to beleeve; they think they do well in keeping off from the Promiſe; they expreſs their tenderneſs of Gods juſtice and holineſs, and judge it a great wrong to both, that God ſhould bee merciful to ſuch ſinners as they. But I muſt tell thee, it is a greater ſin than all thy ſins; a killing, a murthering, an undoing ſin. It is a finiſhing ſin that ſeals thee up in a ſtate of ſin; and therefore you had need to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it, and humbled for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Bee yee quickned to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I do now to perſwade with you, who are <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve,</hi> to come in and beleeve? Alas! all that I can ſay is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if God do not mightily work upon your hearts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade with you.</p>
                  <p>Shall I tell you there is an inexhauſtible fulneſs of mercy in God, and merit in Chriſt for the greateſt ſinner among you; and this is ſomething. Shall I ſay that God is willing to forgive the greateſt ſinner of you, if you will now come in and beleeve?</p>
                  <p>If you will go by Gods revealed will, and thou haſt no other rule to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97371:159"/> go by, nor to bee judged by, there God tells thee that hee keeps open houſe, hee invites, hee excites, hee intreats, hee beſeeches to come; theſe were ſomething to perſwade with our hearts. But I ſhall paſs them. I will only name theſe two to perſwade.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider, God commands thee to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider, thou can do God no greater pleaſure than to come in and beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider, God commands thee to beleeve,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandement, that wee ſhould beleeve on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what can thy heart now reaſon againſt this? will not this bee enough to anſwer all thy fears and ſcruples? to beat down all that thy unbeleeving heart can ſay againſt the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Why God doth not only invite thee, but hee commands thee to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Gods command is a ſufficient warrant to beleeve, and will bee ſufficient ſecurity to all them that do beleeve.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay it is a ſufficient warrant to beleeve. Men may command things, and tell us that our obedience to them ſhall bee ſufficient warrant to us, and yet they may want power enough to ſecure us in our obedience to them, but it is not ſo with God, his command will be a warrant ſufficient to carry out any ſoul in his obedience to him. Doth Satan ſay, wherefore doſt thou beleeve? thou art a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, thou art a caſt away, thou haſt no right to the Promiſe; but thou muſt ſay then, thou art a Creature, and God commands thee to beleeve, and in obedience to Gods command, though thou ſees nothing but death for the preſent, yet thou wilt beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Doth bee ſay, thou haſt no right to a Promiſe, not any title to Mercy: yet mayeſt thou ſay, thou art bound to the Precept; though I cannot clear my right to the Promiſe, yet I am ſure I am to obey the Precept; I am bound to the obedience of the command, and God commands mee to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and thou may ſay thus much, if I am bound to beleeve (as I am) then I may bee able by my beleeving to clear my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou mayeſt tell him here is a command for thee, none then for him, hee is out of hope. It is an infinite mercy to ſtand under the command of beleeving, the Devils do not, the damned do not, thou doeſt, which is infinite mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Gods command is a ſufficient warrant to beleeve, ſo it is ſufficient ſecurity if wee do beleeve; there was never a ſoul that periſhed in a way of obedience, in a way of beleeving.</p>
                  <p>Doth Satan ſay, thou mayeſt venture thy ſoul if thou wilt? but thou doſt but caſt away thy ſoul, for thou ſhalt never bee ſaved, God will never own thee.</p>
                  <p>Thou mayeſt ſay again, Gods command is a ſufficient warrant for thee to beleeve; men may fail us and bee men, but God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail us and bee God.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:97371:159"/>
                  <p>But put it to the worſt, though thou do not know whether thou ſhalt bee ſaved, yet this thou knoweſt, that God commands thee to beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Well then, bee peremptory, and reſolve in beleeving; ſay, if I dye, I will dye in a way of beleeving, in a way of obedience to the command, not in a way of diſobedience to it.</p>
                  <p>This I know, if I beleeve not, I muſt periſh, <hi>hee that beleeveth not is condemned,</hi> but if I do beleeve, if I do go on in a way of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, who knows whether God will bee mercifull? nay, who knows not but that hee will? I muſt tell you, this reſolution will put the Devil to it, hee knows not what to ſay to ſuch a man; nay and it puts God to it too, for God cannot reject him, who will yet go on to ſerve him, though hee ſhould never own him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider, you can do God no greater pleaſure than to come in and beleeve.</hi> Thou honoureſt all-God, as I ſhall ſhew thee in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Doctrin.</p>
                  <p>It is a great deal of eaſe and pleaſure for a full and pained breaſt to bee ſucked; the breaſt of Mercy and Promiſe is full, yea and in pain too, and thou ſhalt do God (let mee ſpeak after the manner of men) the greateſt pleaſure thou canſt do, to come and ſuck, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.28. when the people asked, <hi>what ſhall wee do, that wee may work the works of God?</hi> Mark then how Chriſt anſwers; <hi>why this is the work of God, that you beleeve in him.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, would you do that which would content God? would you do that which pleaſeth him? why this is that which doth wonderfully content God, this is that doth admirably pleaſe God, to beleeve. I tell thee by this thou makeſt God amends for all the wrong thou haſt done him all thy life. Nothing elſe will; if thou ſhouldeſt go about to redeem every oath with an age of precizeneſs and exactneſs; every idle word and action with an eternity of praiſes and tears; all thy exactions and injuſtice with a treaſury of alms; all this were nothing to the making of God amends. But here do but come over to the Promiſe, do but cloſe with Chriſt, and thou makeſt God amends for all, God will bee fully ſatisfied, not with thy Faith, but with Chriſt, not with thy beleeving, but with Chriſt, whom thy Faith holds up. Nay, not only ſatisfied, but <hi>ipſe tibi velim &amp; debitor.</hi> I would not only bee ſatisfied, but I would bee thy debtor, to give thee eternal life. Oh then that you who are <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve,</hi> that you would now come in. Cloſe with Chriſt, and then thou mayeſt ſet Chriſt againſt all that the Law, Juſtice, Sin, Hell, Satan can ſay againſt thee. You ſee the Apoſtle did ſo; <hi>who is hee that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed:</hi> Hee makes a challenge of all; ſets the death of Chriſt againſt whatever can bee brought; ſo may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou. Let us weild this weapon, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doth Satan ſay thou haſt ſinned?</p>
                  <p>Why, but may the ſoul ſay, I have cloſed with him who hath ſuffered for ſin, what can my debt of ſin bee, that the payment of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:97371:160"/> his ſufferings hath not fully anſwered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doth hee ſay thou haſt ſinned againſt the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? yea, but thou mayeſt ſay, I have an intereſt in him, whoſe Righteouſneſs is the Righteouſneſs of the great God of Heaven. <hi>Jehovah</hi> our Righteouſneſs, and that is able to ſuffice for that.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doth hee ſay the glory of the great God is debaſed by thy ſinning? Why, but thou mayeſt ſay, will not the emptying of his glory, who is the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, anſwer for that?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Doth hee ſay thou haſt ſinned againſt knowledge? Why but thou mayeſt ſay, all that Chriſt did, and all hee ſuffered, hee did with knowledge, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Jeſus knowing all things, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Doth hee ſay thou haſt ſinned with delight? Why, but thou mayeſt ſay, Chriſt hath ſuffered with greater delight, than I have ſinned. Hee delighted to do the will of God, and this was the will of his Father, <hi>that hee ſhould give his life for mee,</hi> Joh. 6. Luk. 12.50. And it was ſaid of him, that hee was ſtraitned till the hour came, as men that delight in a work which they long to bee upon.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Doth hee ſay thy ſins lye in thy ſpirit? Yea, but thou mayeſt ſay, the chiefeſt part of his ſuffering did lye in his ſpirit; <hi>his ſoul was heavy to death,</hi> Mat. 26.38. <hi>when hee ſweat drops of blood, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 22.44.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Doth hee ſay thou art ſtill full of corruptions? Why, but thou mayeſt ſay, Chriſt is full of holineſs, and by him, <hi>though I bee black, yet I am comely.</hi> As I look not to be juſtified by mine own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſneſs, ſo I ſhall not bee condemned for this remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning corruption, ſo long as it is not reigning, ſo long as ſeen and ſorrowed for. Though I deſire to bee acceptable to him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet I do not deſire that my holineſs ſhould bee the ground of my acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Thus may a ſoul which hath cloſed with Chriſt bee able to weild this, to ſet Chriſt againſt whatever Juſtice, Law, Sin, Satan brings. Oh! then let us bee ſtirred up, you that are <hi>ſlow of heart to beleeve</hi> to come over; thou ſeeſt thou canſt do him no greater pleaſure. Thou thinkeſt thou doſt well in doubting, but thou doſt exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly offend God; thou canſt not do him a greater diſcourteſy, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But doth God command every one to beleeve pardon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> God commands every one to do the act of Faith, but not to beleeve a pardon till hee have done that.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall get hold of the horns of the Altar, and yet reſt in ſin, God will deal with him as <hi>Joab,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.28, 29. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>God commands thee not to beleeve a pardon, ſo long as thou purpoſeſt to go on in ſin, but yet hee alwayes commands thee to beleeve him, ſo as to give up thy ſelf to Chriſt, &amp;c. that thereby thou mayeſt have pardon, and aſſurance, and ſalvation.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſeek God,]</hi> and not for a time only, in a ſtorm, in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as many will do. Beleeve mee, they go further. <hi>They ſeek mee daily.</hi> They had their <hi>morning and evening Prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They delight to know my wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They knew the wayes of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They delighted to know his wayes;</hi> which is equivalent to this; they did not only <hi>know</hi> the wayes of God, but <hi>deſired to know</hi> the wayes of God; and for ought I know, might have ſome kinde of delight in the knowledge of his wayes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>As a Nation that did Righteouſneſs, and forſook not the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of their God.]</hi> That is, if you looked upon them, they would ſeem to bee as holy a people, as any I have in the World. There is none who would judge otherwiſe of them by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but that they were as holy, as ſincere, as any in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97371:163"/> the World. Though they were not <hi>a Nation</hi> that <hi>did Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> yet they <hi>appeared</hi> to bee ſo: They were <hi>as a Nation, that did Righteouſneſs;</hi> not only <hi>as a Nation,</hi> who <hi>heard,</hi> who <hi>knew,</hi> who <hi>ſpake Righteouſneſs;</hi> but <hi>as a Nation</hi> that <hi>did Righteouſneſs.</hi> They appeared to the judgement of the World to bee as <hi>exact</hi> as the <hi>choiceſt Saints,</hi> which God had in the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>They ask of God the Ordinances of Juſtice.]</hi> They deſire and pray that God would inform them in the wayes of Juſtice; how they ſhould bee governed and ruled in the World: a people which hath reſpect to their <hi>civil Laws and Government,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>deſire Gods Warrant, Gods Direction, Gods Rule in all things;</hi> As if they would do nothing, even in their <hi>civil Affairs,</hi> without <hi>Gods ſpecial Warrant and Direction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>They take delight in approaching to God.]</hi> Than which, how can wee have an higher expreſſion? What? <hi>do they approach to God?</hi> and <hi>daily approach to God,</hi> as you ſee in the beginning? And do they <hi>delight in approaching to God?</hi> do they <hi>delight in hearing?</hi> do they <hi>delight in praying?</hi> do they <hi>delight in approaching to God, in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances?</hi> Here was a <hi>ſtupendious height,</hi> What can wee ſay more? how can wee go any higher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here wee may ſtand and tremble; ſtand and bee aſtoniſhed; ſtand and bee amazed. <hi>Lord, who is hee that ſhall bee ſaved!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>May men do <hi>thus much,</hi> and yet <hi>fall ſhort of Heaven?</hi> what will become of thee, that <hi>doſt nothing?</hi> what will become of thee, <hi>thou Drunkard?</hi> what will become of thee, <hi>thou Swearer? thou prophane Perſon?

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the <hi>aſtoniſhing height,</hi> which yet an <hi>unſound ſpirit</hi> may reach unto. How much may bee done by a man, and yet bee <hi>unſound here, and fall ſhort of Heaven hereafter!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that now I ſhall <hi>trouble</hi> you, but with one <hi>Doctrin.</hi> (And I beleeve, before I have done it, it will <hi>trouble you.</hi>) And that ſhall bee from the <hi>general,</hi> the whole body of the Text together; and it is this.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>It is poſsible for a man, to do much in the wayes of God; even to abound in all outward Performances, and yet bee falſe at the heart; and yet have an unſound ſpirit here, and miſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Doctrin</hi> you ſee the Text ſpeaks plainly. To this I will adde but one <hi>Inſtance</hi> more, which may prove the whole Doctrin; and that you have, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.16. to 23. You read there of <hi>ones comming to Christ. A young man, a rich man, one,</hi> who had <hi>great Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions,</hi> and <hi>a Ruler too,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.18. All which was rare. <hi>A young man! a rich man! a Ruler to come to Chriſt!</hi> you ſhall read there <hi>his buſineſs</hi> alſo. Hee came, <hi>not to tempt him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non animo tentantis, ſed voto diſcentis</note> 
                     <hi>to inſnare him,</hi> aothers did: but <hi>to learn, and be inſtructed by him.</hi> And
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97371:164"/> the <hi>thing</hi> hee deſires to bee inſtructed in, is not <hi>ſome frivolous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling matter,</hi> which others came to <hi>Chriſt</hi> withall. But that which was the matter of his inquiry, was <hi>a matter of eternal concernment.</hi> viz. <hi>What hee might do, that hee might bee ſaved; that hee might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit everlasting life.</hi> Here was ſomething here in this. <hi>A young man; a rich man; a Ruler, to come to Chriſt with deſire to bee inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, how hee ſhould come to eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſhall now hear <hi>Chriſts</hi> anſwer, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.— <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandements.</hi> There was ſome ſpecial reaſon, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes him ſuch an anſwer? for in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.28, 29. <hi>Chriſt</hi> anſwers the ſame queſtion in another manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Quaerebat ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, &amp; Chriſtus oſtendit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data.</note>But <hi>Chriſt</hi> did here conſider the <hi>quality of the Perſon,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Hee was <hi>a Work-monger,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> puts him to <hi>working. Chriſt</hi> gave him <hi>Phyſick ſutable to his diſtemper. Chriſt</hi> puts him to the <hi>Commandements,</hi> that hee might <hi>convince him, in that,</hi> to bee <hi>imperfect, wherein</hi> hee thought himſelf to bee <hi>perfect;</hi> and would make <hi>that his foil,</hi> which hee thought to bee his greateſt glory.</p>
                  <p>Well, <hi>Chriſt</hi> having put him upon the <hi>Commandements,</hi> the <hi>young man</hi> demands, <hi>which of the Commandements;</hi> as if hee had ſaid; — <hi>There is none of them, but I have already done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> you ſee puts him to the <hi>Moral</hi> Law. Seeing hee will have Heaven and bee <hi>juſtified by Moſes; Moſes</hi> ſhall bee his <hi>Judge;</hi> and there rehearſeth diverſe Precepts of the ſecond Table.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>young man,</hi> you ſee makes anſwer in <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. — <hi>All theſe things have I kept from my youth; what lack I yet? Haſt thou any more to command? Is there any more to bee done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was now much, hee ſaid. If wee may beleeve him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee obeyed.</hi> Hee was not only one, who did <hi>know the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;</hi> but one who <hi>kept the Commandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee obeyed univerſally:</hi> not ſome, but all. — <hi>All theſe things have I kept.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee had obeyed conſtantly. — All theſe things have I kept from my youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſure there was much of truth in what hee ſaid. For it is ſaid upon this — <hi>Chriſt looked upon him, and loved him,</hi> as <hi>Mark</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21.</p>
                  <p>No queſtion hee had obeyed the letter of the command: there was none could detect him, but <hi>Christ;</hi> however, hee failed in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the command.</p>
                  <p>Hee did not break them in the <hi>outward action,</hi> though hee did not keep them in the <hi>inward affection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet for all this, <hi>this man was unſound,</hi> as hee diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bee afterward: for all this, <hi>this man fell ſhort of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet alas! How far doth this man excel <hi>a thouſand of us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that you ſee, the <hi>Doctrin</hi> plain in the groſs, in the bulk, <hi>ſcil. That it is poſsible for a man to do much in the wayes of God, and yet to be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97371:164"/> unſound at heart: to abound in all outward Performances, and yet to miſs of Heaven in the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But wee'l come to clear it to you, in the <hi>Particulars.</hi> And wee will follow this <hi>Method;</hi> in theſe four <hi>Particulars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Wee will clear it to you in diverſe inſtances from the word, that it is poſsible ſo to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Wee will ſhew how this may ſtand both</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>With Gods ends.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>With Satans ends.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>With mans own ends, To do much, to abound in duty, and yet not to bee ſincere.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Wee will ſhew you the grounds, whence it ariſeth, that a corrupt heart may abound in all outward Performances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Wee'l ſhew you where the fault is; how it comes to paſs; that all this may bee done, and yet the heart ſtill remain unſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which I ſhall deſire, that they who are men and women of <hi>tender ſpirits,</hi> would not <hi>preſently make concluſions againſt themſelves; and by ſo doing, gratifie Satan, diſcourage their own ſouls, grieve Gods Spirit, and wound and weaken themſelves in the wayes of Grace.</hi> But hear all, (for I cannot ſay <hi>all at once</hi>) and then ſpare not, but come to <hi>concluſions</hi> with your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall deſire ſo to <hi>caſt down the unſound, as not to weaken the ſincere.</hi> And to <hi>bring in thoſe that are without,</hi> as not to <hi>caſt down thoſe that are within.</hi> So to help the one, as that withall I hurt not the other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt then. Wee will clear it in ſome particulars, that it is poſſible for a man to do much, to go far in outward performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of duty, and yet to bee rotten at heart, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is poſſible for a man to <hi>hear the word;</hi> nay, and <hi>hear it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;</hi> nay, and <hi>abound in hearing,</hi> time after time, Sabbath after Sabbath. Nay, and yet more, <hi>to hear it with affection too,</hi> and yet not to bee <hi>ſincere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That hee may hear the Word:</hi> This is plain, and needs no proof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That hee may hear it often, abound in hearing.</hi> This you ſee here in the Text; and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31, 32. where the people <hi>frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hear</hi> Ezekiel. They did not only <hi>ſometimes,</hi> but they <hi>heard him often.</hi> They did <hi>abound in hearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>They may not only hear, and hear often; but hear with affections.</hi> Wee read of theſe four <hi>Affections,</hi> which were ſtirred in the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> of the <hi>Word;</hi> and that in ſuch, who were <hi>unſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The affection of wonder, and aſtoniſhment,</hi> which indeed is the <hi>Mover</hi> of all the affections, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.28. — <hi>When the people heard him, they were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrin.</hi> The like wee read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.54. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.22. <hi>All bare him witneſs, and wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. — All wondred,</hi> but <hi>All</hi> were not <hi>ſavingly wrought upon.</hi> That is the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:97371:165"/>2. <hi>They may hear it with affections of fear and trembling.</hi> Thus you know <hi>Foelix heard</hi> Paul, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. — <hi>When</hi> Paul <hi>preached of Temperance, and Righteouſneſs, and Judgement to come,</hi> Foel x <hi>trembled.</hi> It ſtruck <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> into his heart. It ſet him on <hi>trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>They may hear the word with affections of delight, and ſome kinde of love.</hi> You ſee in the Text, — <hi>They did delight to know Gods waies, and did delight in approaching to God.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31, 32. — <hi>They come and ſit before thee, as my people. They hear thy words, and thou art to them as a very lovely ſong. They hear thy words, but they do them not. With their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goes after their Covetouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>They may hear the word, with affection of Joy.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> Mark 6.20. <hi>That</hi> Herod <hi>feared and obſerved</hi> John; <hi>and when hee heard him, hee did many things, and heard him gladly.</hi> The like you have, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20. — <hi>The ſtony ground heard the word, and anon with joy received it: yet wanting root in the time of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they fell away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So you ſee the firſt particular cleared. A man may <hi>hear the word;</hi> hee may <hi>hear it often; abound in hearing:</hi> Hee may <hi>hear it with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi> and yet his <hi>heart</hi> may bee <hi>unſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man may not only <hi>hear,</hi> but <hi>pray too;</hi> nay, <hi>and make many prayers, abound in praying.</hi> Hee may <hi>pray in publick, pray in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, pray in the Church, pray in his family, pray in his cloſet,</hi> which laſt commeth nearer to ſincerity, And may <hi>make ſtrong cries;</hi> Hee may <hi>pray with affections,</hi> i. e. ſuch <hi>affections</hi> as <hi>ſenſe</hi> ſtirs up; but not ſuch <hi>affections</hi> as <hi>Faith</hi> ſtirs up; ſuch <hi>affections</hi> as are raiſed up by ſome <hi>preſent ſting and ſmart,</hi> ſome <hi>trouble and preſſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> though not with ſuch <hi>affections</hi> as are raiſed up by <hi>Faith, quickned by Gods ſanctifying Spirit. Affections of love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, and they may joyn <hi>faſting to Prayer:</hi> nay, further, adde <hi>mourning to faſting.</hi> And yet their <hi>hearts</hi> may bee <hi>unſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot ſtand to clear all the Particulars. The main I ſhall make to appear to you, in two or three places.</p>
                  <p>Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. — <hi>When you ſtretch forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when you make many prayers; when you mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply prayer; adde prayer to prayer,</hi> as the word imports. — <hi>Yet I will not hear, your hands are full of blood;</hi> i. e. you are <hi>unregenerate,</hi> you are <hi>unſound</hi> in your ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee a great deal cleared in this. A man may <hi>pray; abound in praying; multiply prayers, &amp;c.</hi> And yet bee <hi>unſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And you may joyn <hi>faſting to prayer;</hi> as you ſee in the next verſe to my Text, and in the example of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who <hi>prayed often, and faſted often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And you may joyn <hi>mourning to faſting,</hi> Zach. 7.5. — <hi>When you faſted and mourned in the fifth month, even theſe ſeventy years,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:97371:165"/> did you at all faſt to mee? even to mee?</hi> They ſerved <hi>themſelves, not God</hi> in that action all thoſe <hi>ſeventy years</hi> together, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. — <hi>and they have not cryed to mee with their hearts, when they howled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their beds; they aſſemble themſelves for Corn and Wine;</hi> (that's the ground of their <hi>faſting and howling.) For they rebel againſt mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the ſecond Particular.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A man may ſeem to bee humbled, to mourn and weep for ſin:</hi> and yet bee <hi>unſound.</hi> A man cannot <hi>mourn for ſin, as ſin,</hi> but his heart is <hi>ſincere:</hi> but a man may <hi>ſeem to mourn for ſin,</hi> and yet his heart not bee <hi>ſincere.</hi> Hee may <hi>mourn for ſin clad with wrath: for ſin cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with Judgement and Diſpleaſure: for ſin, as it ſmels of Hell, Fire, and Brimſtone: for ſin, as it appears in its dooms-day attire.</hi> So did <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſo <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Crocodile-tears;</hi> There are <hi>falſe tears,</hi> as well as <hi>falſe prayers.</hi> As a <hi>broken heart</hi> doth not ever expreſſe it ſelf in <hi>tears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>As wee ſay of God; <hi>Hee hath his communicable and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Attributes;</hi> ſomething which is in <hi>himſelf</hi> only, as his <hi>Infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> his <hi>Omnipreſence, &amp;c.</hi> and ſomething whereof there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, ſome footſteps in the Creatures: ſo the Saints, they have ſomething which is <hi>communicable;</hi> ſomething whereof there is ſome reſemblance in others, and which others do as well as they; though not in the ſame <hi>Manner.</hi> And there is ſomething <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable</hi> to any but to <hi>Saints;</hi> ſuch things as are <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> only. And they are ſuch things as are <hi>Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> to a <hi>Christian,</hi> as a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> And that is the firſt thing impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word <hi>[Form.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

This is implied in the word <hi>(Form.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As a <hi>Picture,</hi> if it were not perfect in every limb, if there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any member, as an <hi>Hand,</hi> an <hi>Eye,</hi> nay but a <hi>Finger,</hi> it could not bee ſaid to bee a <hi>compleat Picture:</hi> ſo is it here.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That no Hypocrite hath any thing in him eſſential to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> no more than a <hi>Picture,</hi> that which is eſſential to a man.</p>

                  <p>Hee may bee able to do all the <hi>outwards:</hi> every duty for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals, which lies within the latitude and compaſs of a Chriſtians walking with God.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>God makes uſe of the parts and abilities of ſome, whoſe perſons hee will not own, for the advancement of the work of grace, in the hearts of his people.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Raven</hi> was an <hi>unclean</hi> Creature under the Law: yet God made uſe of the <hi>Raven,</hi> to bring fleſh and food to <hi>Elijah.</hi> Though the <hi>Raven</hi> was not <hi>good meat,</hi> yet it was <hi>good meat</hi> which the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> brought.</p>
                  <p>So God doth oftentimes make uſe of ſuch, who are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>unclean,</hi> for the feeding and nouriſhing of his people. The food may bee <hi>good,</hi> though the perſon that brings it may bee <hi>naught.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> told the people, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.2, 3. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees, they ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>chair: and therefore whatever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do: but do yee not after their works: for they ſay, but do not.</hi> As if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid. <hi>They are ſet up, and furniſhed with abilities, to do you good; though they are naught them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Therefore let their Doctrin build you up, for it is of God: and let not their practice throw you down, for that is of the Devil, and themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pearl</hi> in the <hi>Toads head</hi> may bee uſeful and good, though the <hi>Body</hi> bee poiſon. And the abilities of ſuch men may bee ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to you, though their perſons bee unclean.</p>
                  <p>Thus may it ſtand with Gods ends <hi>toward the good, that corrupt hearts ſhould abound in all the wayes of duty.</hi> And this is one end, for the advancement of the work of Grace, in the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Though this bee not their aim; though it bee not their end; yet it is Gods end. They have theirs, and God hath his end.</p>
                  <p>As it is ſaid of the <hi>King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. God uſed him for a rod and ſcourge to puniſh his people. God had his end, and hee had his. It was Gods end, that hee ſhould ſpoil and puniſh them for their ſin: but his, to inrich himſelf by the ſpoil; as the Text tells us. Howbeit, <hi>Though I ſend him, to puniſh them for their ſins</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>yet hee, the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>meaneth not ſo, nor doth his heart think ſo: it is in his heart to cut off, and deſtroy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not a few.</hi> Though hee ſerved his own ends, yet Gods end went forward alſo.</p>
                  <p>The like of <hi>Jehu,</hi> hee ſerved his own ends, in the deſtruction of <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe. Though hee cryes out, <hi>Come ſee my Zeal for the Lord.</hi> However Gods ends were brought about alſo, in the ruine of <hi>Ahabs</hi> poſterity, as hee had threatned.</p>
                  <p>So here. Though it bee not the end of corrupt hearts, in the doing of holy actions, <hi>Prayer, Preaching, Exhortation, &amp;c.</hi> to bring <hi>God any Glory,</hi> to do <hi>good</hi> to others: they have their own ends. Yet ſtill Gods work goes forward in it. God hath his ends, as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:97371:167"/> well as they theirs. God gets Glory, as well as they credit. God makes ſin, the Devil himſelf, to ſerve his Glory. Otherwiſe hee would not ſuffer nor Devil, nor Sin, to bee in the World. So that hee makes them, in aiming at themſelves, to bring about his Glory.</p>
                  <p>As an <hi>unſound ſpirit</hi> doth ſerve his turn of God: ſo God again ſerves his turn of them: hee is even with them.</p>
                  <p>God oftentimes uſeth ſuch to bee inſtruments to do others good, who are bad themſelves: to work upon others, though they themſelves remain unwrought upon: to bee a Bridge to help others over.</p>
                  <p>To hold out the <hi>Lanthorne</hi> to others, and go in the dark them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As it often fareth with them, who hold the <hi>Lanthorne;</hi> they go moſt in the dark themſelves, they ſerve others, direct and guide others in the night with their light, not themſelves. So if God do not bring light into their hearts: there are none, who are more in darkneſs, than ſuch as hold out the light to others: yet</p>
                  <p>Another may receive good, by that Sermon, which the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er himſelf is never the better for: another, warmth by that prayer, whereby hee himſelf that prayes, is never the hotter. And ſo in the reſt. And therefore it may ſtand with Gods ends, <hi>that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearts ſhould abound in duties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God ſuffers corrupt hearts to abound in duties, to maintain an holy jealouſy and watchfulneſs in the hearts of his own people.</hi> Why (will they reaſon) if men may do thus much, and yet bee unſound; what need have wee then to bee jealous over our own hearts, watchful over our ſpirits in the midſt of our performances?</p>
                  <p>Oh! this will make a man jealous of himſelf, with a godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: not to truſt too much to himſelf, when hee's at beſt, when hee doth moſt abound in duties. And this holy jealouſie is of ſpecial uſe to keep us humble, to make us watchful, exact in our wayes, to fenſe our hearts againſt Hypocriſie. It was never known that a <hi>jealous heart</hi> was a <hi>falſe heart.</hi> An holy jealouſie over a mans ſpirit was never accompanied with an unſound ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third End. It is, <hi>to make us ſee there is ſomething in duty, more than duty, which ſets a value upon duty, and makes it of worth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If all were <hi>ſound,</hi> who did duty, wee ſhould then think <hi>duty it ſelf to bee all;</hi> whereas now it makes us look after ſomething elſe, <hi>above duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will make a man look to the <hi>Manner,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Matter,</hi> when wee ſee the <hi>Matter</hi> is nothing worth, without the <hi>right Manner</hi> do accompany it.</p>
                  <p>This will force a mans heart above duty. God never made <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the end of Duty.</hi> If all were <hi>ſound</hi> that <hi>did Duty,</hi> wee ſhould reſt upon a <hi>bare performance of Duty, and look no higher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, ſeeing it is poſſible for a man to <hi>abound in Duty,</hi> and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:97371:168"/> yet bee <hi>unſound;</hi> this will force a mans heart above the <hi>Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. To tell us, that <hi>there are other things to bee done of a Christian, than meerly to pray, hear, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a man may do all, <hi>and ſink into Hell,</hi> when hee hath done: then ſure there is more required of thoſe that muſt bee <hi>ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All <hi>Religion</hi> doth not lye in a <hi>few Prayers, Hearing of Sermons.</hi> Though this muſt bee done, they have not ſo much as a ſhew of goodneſs, who neglect theſe: yet there are other things to bee done too, if ever wee would <hi>come to Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. God ſuffers corrupt hearts to <hi>abound in duty, to make his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more ſollicitous after ſurer, more ſtable, and proving evidences,</hi> than theſe are.</p>
                  <p>If theſe anchors ſhould alwayes hold, men would never labour to caſt out better. If all, that <hi>did dutie,</hi> nay, that <hi>did abound in duty</hi> had been <hi>ſound,</hi> wee ſhould never have ſought out for better evidences than theſe are.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, this being diſcovered, that a man may <hi>abound in duty,</hi> and yet for all this <hi>bee unſound:</hi> this will make a man to look out for <hi>better evidences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man that is bent for Heaven indeed, will never ſuffer his ſoul to reſt, till hee hath gotten ſome ſuch evidences, as are <hi>incompatible</hi> to a man <hi>out of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, will hee ſay, <hi>May a man hear, and go to Hell? pray, and periſh? do duty, and yet bee damned at laſt? Then theſe are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bottomes for mee, to build the weight of my everlaſting ſoul upon. I muſt either get a better bottome, ſurer evidences than theſe, or both I and my prayers may ſink together at laſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Why, will wicked men ſay? others, who have been as forward in profeſſion, as great <hi>Prayers,</hi> and as great <hi>Hearers</hi> as you are, they have proved <hi>unſound,</hi> diſcovered themſelves to bee <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and ſo are you, and all the reſt of you.</p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:97371:168"/>
                  <p>And thus you ſee it turns to them, as an occaſion of offence; and further ſtrengthening of their diſlike of the wayes and people of God. Men, whoſe hearts are ſet againſt the wayes of God, ſhall bee furniſht with matter enough to bring them into further diſlike daily.</p>
                  <p>If you deſire to have arguments againſt Gods wayes, you ſhall have enough of them to your coſt. You ſhall bee furniſht with them; but to your further hardening. If you will keep a rooted diſlike of the wayes of God, you ſhall finde enough in the World to nouriſh it. If you bee willing to bee offended, you ſhall have offences enough to your further hardening. If you bee willing to ſtumble at the wayes of God, you ſhall have ſtumbling ſtones e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who was the <hi>Corner ſtone, Elect, Precious;</hi> yet <hi>to the Diſobedient hee was a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence. A ſtone</hi> as well for the <hi>Fall,</hi> as for the <hi>riſing of many in</hi> Iſrael, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34.</p>
                  <p>Men that are willing to take offences, ſhall have them. Thoſe who will bee blinde, ſhall bee blinded. They, who will bee hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhall have hardening enough. If the <hi>Word do not teach you; works do blinde you.</hi> If the <hi>Word do not ſoften you, works do harden you.</hi> If you <hi>ſtumble at the Word, you will fall at works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, Men firſt ſtumble at the <hi>Word,</hi> before they ſtumble at <hi>Works:</hi> They firſt take offence at duties the <hi>Word</hi> commands, and then ſtrengthen that offence, by the failings of thoſe, who walk in thoſe wayes.</p>
                  <p>Works do but ſtrengthen your diſlike of things in the <hi>Word.</hi> The failings of perſons, that walk in this way, do but further ſtrengthen your diſlike of the things commanded in the <hi>Word.</hi> This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhews, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Chriſt was a stone of ſtumbling.</hi> But to whom? why <hi>to thoſe,</hi> who <hi>ſtumbled at the Word</hi> firſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have <hi>ſtumbled at the Word,</hi> then they <hi>ſtumble at Chriſt.</hi> So when you have <hi>ſtumbled,</hi> and taken offence againſt theſe <hi>duties,</hi> which the <hi>Word</hi> commands; no marvel if you <hi>ſtumble</hi> here; and by the failings of thoſe, who walk in the way of life, gather argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſtrengthen your diſlike of the way it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This is thy ſpirit; though thou ſee it not. Thy heart is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the wayes of God, praying, hearing, faſting; and thou fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheſt thy ſelf with inſtances of ſome, who have proved unſound in the way, that ſo thou mayeſt ſtrengthen thy heart more with diſlike againſt it.</p>
                  <p>And thus it proves an occaſion of further blinding, of further hardening to thee.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It may ſtand with Satans ends, towards the good;</hi> and therefore hee will not diſturb theſe men in their way, but lets them go on.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby Satan doth labour to cauſe Gods People to throw off the work; to deſiſt in their way.</hi> Why, will Satan ſay, what do you macerate and afflict your ſelves in a way, wherein is no more good? What can you do more than others have done? They have prayed, and they have prayed often, and made many Prayers. They have heard, and heard often; yea and heard with affection, with fear, with joy, and delight, &amp;c. They have faſted, and have joyned mourning with faſting. They have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken their evil wayes, wherein they have formerly walked; and have entred upon Gods wayes, joyned themſelves to the Ordinances, to the People of God. And yet, <hi>for all this, theſe people have come to nought. For all this, their hearts were unſound here, and they have periſhed after all.</hi> And therefore (will Satan ſay) If a man may <hi>pray, and periſh; do duties, and bee damned; hear, and get to Hell</hi> at laſt; why doſt thou then thus trouble thy ſelf, and afflict thy ſelf in this way? Thou ſeeſt there is no hope of doing good in it. And therefore, why wilt thou abridge thy ſelf of thoſe pleaſures, thoſe comforts, which others have in the World? why wilt thou go on to macerate and afflict thy ſelf in theſe wayes? were it not better for thee to <hi>throw off all, and betake thy ſelf to the World, to profits, to pleaſures, and injoy thy hearts content</hi> as well as <hi>others?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee Satan is furniſht with a <hi>dangerous argument</hi> againſt Gods People, which hee could not have had, <hi>if unſound hearts did not abound in duty, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If hee cannot prevail with Gods people hereby, <hi>to throw off the work;</hi> but that notwithſtanding all this, they are reſolved <hi>to pray, though they periſh; to beleeve, to obey, though God ſhould never reward their obedience;</hi> yet hee hath a ſecond <hi>End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee labours to diſcourage Gods People hereby in the work,</hi> and to make them <hi>drive heavily</hi> in their way to Heaven. Satan knows full well, that if <hi>their heart bee diſcouraged in the work, their hands will bee weakened for the work.</hi> And therefore hee labours, by ſuch preſidents as theſe are, who have done ſo much in the wayes of God, and yet are <hi>unſound; to make men ſit down diſcouraged, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of ever doing good in theſe wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, will Satan ſay, How canſt thou do more, than ſuch and ſuch have done? <hi>Canſt thou pray more Prayers? hear more Sermons? do more Duties? keep more Dayes? ingage thy ſelf more deeply in the Cauſe of God, than others have done? who have yet come to nought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may bee hee'l tell thee. Thou art weak, thou wanteſt thoſe parts, thoſe abilities, that ſtrength, that power to <hi>do God that</hi>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:97371:169"/> 
                     <hi>ſervice, which others</hi> have done. <q>And therefore e'ne caſt off all, or elſe <hi>deſpair</hi> of ever doing good, in this way, wherein others have outſtript thee; and yet were <hi>unſound.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus doth Satan make uſe of this argument, if not to prevail with men; <hi>to caſt off the work,</hi> yet <hi>to diſcourage them in the work.</hi> And therefore it may ſtand with his ends, that unſound hearts may thus abound in performance of duties.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third end which Satan hath towards the <hi>godly,</hi> is, that if hee cannot prevail to make Gods people throw off the work; nor yet diſcourage them in the work; yet hee labours by theſe men <hi>to ſcandalize the godly, to bring evil reports upon all that walk in the way of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is Satans deſire to make the <hi>Perſons</hi> that walk in the way of life, and the way of life it ſelf as odious as hee can, in the eyes of the World. And this is one way, whereby hee labours to bring it about, and findes ſucceſsful in the hearts of many: <hi>even the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of ſuch as have made profeſsion of the Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed the <hi>Cauſe of God,</hi> and the <hi>People of God</hi> have ſuffered much thereby.</p>
                  <p>You know how wicked men argue.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Either from Particulars to Generals:</hi> from the failings of <hi>ſome,</hi> they fall to <hi>cenſuring of all. There is one</hi> (ſay they) <hi>who hath made profeſsion, and hath proved naught. Therefore all are ſo: all alike: none better than other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which yet is an <hi>uncharitable and falſe reaſoning.</hi> If the Saints ſhould argue ſo of you: <hi>There was one unregenerate man a Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a Traitor, a Theef: Therefore all that are unregenerate are Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Murderers, Theeves:</hi> you would think this to bee <hi>uncharitable and falſe reaſoning.</hi> Yet yours is the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or ſecondly, <hi>By the failing of the Perſon,</hi> they take up argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>to charge and condemn the Cauſe:</hi> not only <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> but <hi>Profeſsion it ſelf;</hi> caſting filth and dirt upon the pure face of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>wayes of God</hi> hereby.</p>
                  <p>And Satan knows well enough, that the <hi>Cauſe of God</hi> looſeth more by <hi>one mans unſoundneſs,</hi> than it can gain and recover again by the <hi>ſincerity of many.</hi> It looſeth more in the hearts of wicked men, by the falls of ſome, than it can gain again by the ſtanding of thouſands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Davids</hi> fall, though hee roſe again, cauſed <hi>Religion, and the Wayes of God</hi> to bee blaſphemed by wicked men. It opened the mouths of wicked men to blaſpheme the wayes of God; as the <hi>Prophet</hi> told him.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, God was more diſhonoured by <hi>Davids unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> than hee was by <hi>all the filth of</hi> Sodome. And therefore ſeeing Satan gets ſuch advantage both againſt the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Cauſe of God,</hi> by the <hi>unſoundneſs</hi> of men, that walk in the <hi>Wayes of God:</hi> therefore may it ſtand with Satans ends to ſuffer
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:97371:170"/> 
                     <hi>unſound hearts,</hi> to <hi>abound in duty,</hi> without diſturbing of them. And as it may ſtand with Satans ends, in reſpect of the <hi>godly;</hi> So</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It may ſtand with his Ends, in reſpect of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To keep them off, from entring upon the way of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men will bee affraid to ingage themſelves in ſuch a way, wherein there ſtand up ſuch <hi>ſad Preſidents,</hi> as theſe are. If men may do much, and yet fall off, bee unſound, and fall ſhort of Heaven at laſt, this will diſcourage and diſ-hearten them, from comming in.</p>
                  <p>Men are naturally affraid, when they are to <hi>run hazards and dangers:</hi> to take a great deal of pains in ſuch a way, wherein there are ſo many hazards and dangers to bee run.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To ſtrengthen the prejudice of wicked men againſt the wayes and people of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wicked men are naturally prejudiced againſt the wayes and people of God. They think them all to bee no better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, however they make a ſhew to bee better. And when they ſee this prejudice of theirs confirmed by the example of any one, who hath walked in the way, and yet hath been unſound: This is a matter laid up for ever, here they <hi>hugge</hi> themſelves, and rejoyce in ſuch an example: and ſo their prejudice againſt Gods wayes and people is hereby more ſtrengthened.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third End, which Satan hath towards wicked men, is, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>to harden them, and confirm and ſtrengthen them in a way of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they ſee no better fruit of ſo much <hi>praying, hearing, &amp;c.</hi> They are hardened in their way of ſin, and perſwaded to go on in their old way, their common road ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, how it may ſtand with Satans ends towards the <hi>good,</hi> and towards the <hi>bad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now thirdly, <hi>How it may ſtand with Satans ends towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that thus abound in duty, and yet are unſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To aggravate their condemnation.</hi> Such mens ſins they are great. <hi>Duty doubles ſin.</hi> A <hi>duty</hi> upon the head of a <hi>ſin</hi> makes ſin exceeding hainous. And as the <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo the <hi>condemnation</hi> is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated hereby.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>darkeſt</hi> and <hi>hotteſt</hi> places in <hi>Hell,</hi> are reſerved for ſuch, whoſe hearts are <hi>unſound in the wayes of God.</hi> Such would wiſh to change places with <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens;</hi> all their <hi>duties</hi> are but <hi>ſo much fuel to make the fire of Hell the hotter for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By how much ſuch men are lifted up higher than others in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; by ſo much they ſhall bee thrown down lower than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in truth and reality of torments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe ſuch men are ſureſt his, of any, upon two grounds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If hee ſtand in that condition,</hi> hee thinks hee is ſure enough his. What can rob him of ſuch a man? can <hi>Prayer?</hi> can <hi>Hearing?</hi> Indeed theſe might deprive him of others: but this man he dares <hi>truſt any where, upon any duty:</hi> Hee dares venture him any where: Hee knows his heart is <hi>Prayer-Proof, Sermon-Proof.</hi> All theſe are not ſtrong enough to take him away from him.</p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:97371:170"/>
                  <p>Indeed, hee's affraid of others, though never ſo wicked. Hee fears hee may looſe him at every Sermon, hee may bee robbed of him, at every prayer: And therefore labours all hee can to keep ſuch men off from the work.</p>
                  <p>But now this man hee dares adventure to the moſt powerfull and prevailing ordinances: Hee hath long experience, his heart hath ſtood firm to him in all.</p>
                  <p>Though ſometimes hee hath had ſome ſtings and troubles of conſcience, as certainly it fares often with unſound hearts, who have to do with duties: yet hee can let him alone; hee knows hee will come to his old temper, and return to himſelf again.</p>
                  <p>As hot water will return to its own coldneſs, becauſe there is a quality in it, which reſiſts heat, and inclines to cold; ſo if at any time ſuch a man bee troubled, Satan will let him alone, hee knows there is a Principle in him, which will cauſe him to return to his wonted temper.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If hee fall, hee thinks him ſure enough his.</p>
                  <p>Such mens falls are for the moſt part deſperate and unrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. You know, the greater the height, from which a man falls, the more deſperate and irrecoverable is his fall.</p>
                  <p>Now there can bee no greater an height in the World, from which to fall, than for a man to fall from the Hills of duty, the Mountains of Prayer, the top of profeſſion. This may prove the <hi>irrecoverable downfal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All thy <hi>Duty,</hi> all thy <hi>Prayers,</hi> if thy heart bee unſound, are but ſomething laid in, to make that ſin. All theſe do but ripen and prepare for, and nimble thee, to <hi>commit that ſin,</hi> if thy heart bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound in them.</p>
                  <p>But if the fall bee not deſperate, yet it is dangerous: though not irrecoverable, yet hard to bee recovered.</p>
                  <p>There are many and fearful aggravations of your ſins, all which Satan now uſeth, and ſets on with all his might, to bring you to deſpair. And great is the hazard, hard is the recovery.</p>
                  <p>It hath been often known, <hi>a ſincere heart hath recovered and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ground and ſtrength by his fall.</hi> But ſeldome or never that <hi>an unſound heart got up again after his Fall; never came to his heights;</hi> but rather wallows in miſchief. <hi>David</hi> fell and recovered, but <hi>Judas</hi> fell, and roſe no more.</p>
                  <p>But however, the hazard is great, in regard there are ſo many fearful aggravations of ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their ſins</hi> are <hi>ſins</hi> againſt <hi>Knowledge, Light, Illumination,</hi> which puts much weight to ſin.</p>
                  <p>Sins of ignorance plead for a pardon, though <hi>great.</hi> What <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>the killing of Chriſt?</hi> yet — <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do?</hi> But ſins againſt <hi>Knowledge</hi> do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly aggravate ſin, and makes ſin exceeding ſinful.</p>
                  <p>There is more ſin, more guilt formerly conſidered, in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:97371:171"/> thought againſt <hi>Knowledge,</hi> than there is in an <hi>open groſs ſin</hi> of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> Why; their ſins are ſins againſt Knowledge, againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, againſt Profeſſion, Practice, Prayers, Duties; and therefore great.</p>
                  <p>All their Duties and Prayers that they have done ſhould bee now comforts; but they are burdens, becauſe they are done with <hi>unſound hearts;</hi> and they come in as ſo many aggravations of ſin againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt a man holds up his head in the World, though hee bee but poor, it may bee his Creditors will let him alone; but if once a man bee arreſted, every one then comes with his action upon him; may bee, thoſe hee thought his beſt friends, come then, and lay greateſt burdens upon him.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt an unſound man walks in way of duty, and doth not fall into the commiſſion of ſome groſſe ſin, ſo long it may bee, hee hath quiet. Satan, Conſcience, nothing troubles him. But when once hee is down, then all comes upon him: nay his very Duties themſelves (which hee thought to have moſt good from, and to bee his beſt friends) they come in too, to lay more weight, more guilt, more burden on him. Every Prayer, every Duty, which hee hath done with an unſound heart, is now a burden, a weight, upon his ſpirit; yea, and weighes heavier than all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Here is <hi>trouble</hi> out of expected comfort, which is the <hi>greateſt trouble.</hi> And take this with you, and remember it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatever you do in the wayes of God, if comfort flow not from it, trouble will one day riſe out of it.</hi> If it bee not a bottome for <hi>Faith,</hi> Satan will uſe it as an argument for <hi>Deſpair,</hi> when time ſerves. I ſay, that duty that is done, and cannot miniſter comfort, by the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of the heart, in doing of it, will one day create diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtrengthen <hi>Deſpair. Deſpair</hi> ariſeth from that, where comfort ſhould, but doth not ariſe.</p>
                  <p>But I am too long upon this. This is the ſecond ground, why Satan doth not diſturb ſuch men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may ſtand yet further with Satans ends; and therefore hee doth not diſturb them; becauſe hee hopes to have ſome further good of them another day. Hee knows full well, that they, who will ſerve God for <hi>their own ends,</hi> will ſerve the Devil for <hi>their own ends</hi> too, when hee once out-bids God, and exceeds him in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. It is an eaſy thing to make him the <hi>Devils Prieſt,</hi> who is, <hi>Mammons Chaplain.</hi> You ſee <hi>Demas,</hi> hee was unſound, ſerved God for <hi>By-ends,</hi> for worldly reſpects. And the Devil doth but <hi>out-bid God,</hi> tender more for his ſervice; and hee preſently forſakes God, and cleaves to the World. Hee forſook the <hi>Faith of Chriſt,</hi> and turned to bee an <hi>Idol-Prieſt</hi> at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> as <hi>Dorotheus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of him.</p>
                  <p>This is a <hi>ſure Rule. Hee who ſerves God for the World, will ſerve the Devil for the World.</hi> Hee who ſerves God for little, will
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:97371:171"/> ſerve the Devil for more; hee will eaſily bee brought upon high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tenders, to change his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, men, that have no minde to the <hi>Work,</hi> nor love to the <hi>Master,</hi> but the eye is <hi>only to the wages;</hi> ſuch men will quickly bee drawn upon greater offers, to forſake their <hi>Maſter,</hi> and their <hi>Work</hi> too, and to joyn themſelves to any, where <hi>better wages</hi> may bee found.</p>
                  <p>And you muſt know. <hi>There are no men, whoſe ſervice the Devil doth more deſire, than the ſervice of ſuch, who have made profeſsion.</hi> And that upon diverſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee knows, <hi>They will bee the ſureſt, and moſt truſty ſervants to him of any.</hi> None are more truſty ſouldiers, than ſuch, who have forſaken the <hi>colours</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and fled over to the <hi>Tents</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Such men hee never fears to looſe again: their <hi>Ears are boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> in token of eternal ſubjection to this <hi>black Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As wee ſay of the <hi>Angels. If once they turn, they never return.</hi> There is no poſſibility of their repenting. And this is one ground; becauſe their will hath ſinned againſt ſuch excellent, clear and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent light, that they can never return again; if all that light would not keep their deſperate hearts from ſinning, it ſhall never prevail with them for returning, when once they have ſinned. And God will never give a fuller, a greater light, and therefore they muſt needs bee fixt in their condition of ſin.</p>
                  <p>So I may ſay of theſe in ſome degree. They have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo clear light, ſuch manifeſt evidence, that if they <hi>turn, ſin wilfully:</hi> Hardly do they return again. It is no more but what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, in that ſixth and tenth to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe muſt needs bee truſty ſervants to the <hi>Devil,</hi> they are ſure his.</p>
                  <p>They are his <hi>by choice.</hi> And none <hi>ſurer his,</hi> than they, who are his <hi>by choice.</hi> Now ſuch men, they have choſen him; nay and not only choſen him, but they have choſen him upon <hi>experience and diſlike of their former Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If indeed a man ſhould have choſen Satan, before ever hee had <hi>tryed God,</hi> then were there ſome hopes that his mind might bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, hee might repent of his choice. But when a man hath had a <hi>tryal of God,</hi> and upon <hi>experience and diſlike of God,</hi> and his wayes, chuſeth Satan and the world; theſe are ſure.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, theſe men have <hi>ſold themſelves over to Satan.</hi> Now none are more ſure his, than they, who ſell themſelves over to him.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, wee are <hi>all ſold</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith. — <hi>ſold to ſin.</hi> But now when a man ſhall come, and not only ratifie the bargain, but <hi>make a new ſale of himſelf;</hi> This man is <hi>ſure his.</hi> It is not ſo much what the <hi>Father</hi> hath done, but when the <hi>Son</hi> comes to <hi>age,</hi> and ſhall ratifie what the <hi>Father</hi> hath done, and <hi>make a new
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97371:172"/> Sale:</hi> Nay, Satan doth not only <hi>know</hi> they are <hi>ſure his;</hi> but hee knows <hi>they will bee moſt uſefull Inſtruments for him,</hi> and by theſe things are they ſtrengthened and prepared for his ſervice: and therefore hee will not diſturb them. Hee knows they will by this, bee made better <hi>Engineers</hi> to work for him. They will bee active inſtruments, full of malice againſt God, and his cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Who of all the Emperors was more miſchievous than <hi>Julian?</hi> who had once made profeſſion of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Such men as theſe are <hi>ſet on fire of Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee have a Proverb. <hi>An Engliſh man Italianate,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is a Devil Incarnate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may ſay the ſame; <hi>A Profeſſor Apoſtate,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turns a Devil Incarnate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are none in the World have more of the <hi>Infernal Nature,</hi> than they. <hi>Their Head poiſons, their Heart poiſons.</hi> And <hi>the venome of Aſpes is under their Tongue.</hi> They are <hi>full of Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is ſome <hi>ingenuity in Nature fallen,</hi> though never ſo <hi>bad.</hi> But <hi>Nature once raiſed,</hi> and after <hi>Devilized:</hi> ſuch men are all <hi>fury.</hi> Theſe are Satans <hi>Mogols,</hi> Satans Champions, the chiefeſt of that <hi>black band of Darkneſs:</hi> Such men as theſe, they have ſinned away <hi>Light, Conſcience, all natural remorſe and tenderneſs.</hi> And what can bee expected from them? there is no mans ſword more ſharp and keen than theirs, who have ſharpened it upon the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of God. No mans pen writes ſo bitterly againſt God, his Cauſe and People, than theirs, who have dip'd their pen in the <hi>Blood of Conſcience.</hi> No man fails more deſperately to Hell, than ſuch a man, who hath made <hi>Shipwrack of Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, ſeeing ſuch men are ſo truſty, ſo ſure, ſo active, ſo malicious inſtruments, when they are brought over to him, and it is ſo eaſy a thing to bring them about; no marvel if Satan will not diſturb ſuch men for a time, but lets them go on, till they bee fit for his work. It will ſtand with the deſigns of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſhewed two things, how it may ſtand, 1. With Gods, 2. With Satans ends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now thirdly, <hi>How it may ſtand with their own ends, who having corrupt hearts, yet ſhould notwithſtanding abound in duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To anſwer the calls of Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every man hath a <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And every mans <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth call upon him for the performance of <hi>ſomething.</hi> And the <hi>further conſcience is inlightened, the further work it calls him out upon.</hi> A man inlightened cannot ſerve God ſo <hi>cheaply, with quiet of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> as others, who are not, can.</p>
                  <p>Now there are ſome, who are far convinced, ſome, who are further inlightened than others. And conſcience calls out upon them, for <hi>more work to bee done.</hi> And to anſwer the meer calls of Conſcience, a man <hi>far inlightened</hi> may do much in the wayes of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:97371:172"/> God; and yet his ſpirit bee unſound.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To pacifie the quarrels, to ſatisfie the gripes and gnawings of conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is uſual with men under the pangs and ſtings of <hi>conſcience, To run to the ſprings of duty, to the plaiſters of prayers,</hi> meerly for this end, <hi>To get preſent eaſe, and quiet to their burdened Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> And they often compaſs their end by this means, and get ſome preſent eaſe; though not a ſetled and ſubſtantial Peace. <hi>Such as their diſturbance is, ſuch is their Peace.</hi> As their <hi>diſturbance</hi> was not <hi>ſpiritual</hi> for <hi>ſin:</hi> ſo their <hi>Peace,</hi> it is not <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ariſing from a <hi>cure.</hi> As conſcience was wounded by walking to that <hi>common light, and natural Principles</hi> in it: So is it put in joynt again, by walking anſwerable to them; which works, though but <hi>common</hi> and <hi>general,</hi> yet being all their light diſcovers; they may, by the performance of them, get ſome preſent eaſe, though not a ſound and ſetled Peace.</p>
                  <p>Wee read, <hi>The Heathens had ſtings of Conſcience,</hi> when they <hi>ſinned notoriouſly</hi> againſt the <hi>Light and Principles of Nature.</hi> And wee read, <hi>they had Peace and quiet,</hi> when they <hi>obſerved thoſe things,</hi> which their light diſcovered to them.</p>
                  <p>As their <hi>Terrors</hi> did ariſe from <hi>Convictions of Conſcience,</hi> upon the doing of ſuch things as were <hi>contrary to the Principles of Nature:</hi> ſo their <hi>Peace</hi> did ariſe from the obſervance of ſuch things as were agreeable to that common Light and Principles they had. So it is here. Their <hi>Conviction</hi> doth ariſe from ſome <hi>Common, not ſaving Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it diſcovers <hi>groſs ſins,</hi> not <hi>ſecret ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It diſcovers <hi>open ſins,</hi> not <hi>ſpiritual ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It diſcovers <hi>no ſin,</hi> as <hi>ſin,</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it. Some ſins it diſcovers not at all.</p>
                  <p>And ſo their <hi>Peace</hi> doth ariſe from ſome <hi>common Performances,</hi> ſome <hi>general works,</hi> not <hi>ſpecial and ſaving.</hi> And this is one end, why ſome may <hi>abound in outward Performances, to make themſelves a Plaiſter of the ingredients of Prayers and Duties, to heal their wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d conſciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes thought that <hi>Conſcience</hi> in this caſe, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like to the diſeaſe which they call the <hi>Wolf</hi> in the body. If you <hi>feed not it,</hi> they are wont to ſay, <hi>It will feed upon you.</hi> And therefore in this caſe it is ſaid, they uſed to give it fleſh, that ſo, by feeding on that, it might not gnaw upon them, and by that means have ſome preſent eaſe, though the cure bee not wrought.</p>
                  <p>So it is with <hi>Conſcience.</hi> When once the mouth of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is opened, if a man do not feed it, it will devoure him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men in this caſe do feed <hi>Conſcience</hi> with <hi>duty,</hi> which for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, procures them eaſe, though the cure bee not wrought.</p>
                  <p>And indeed (to ſpeak truth) ſuch men do not <hi>deſire the cure.</hi> They <hi>deſire eaſe,</hi> but not the <hi>cure; Peace,</hi> not <hi>Purging; Quiet,</hi> not
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:97371:173"/> 
                     <hi>Healing.</hi> They would willingly bee rid of the <hi>pain,</hi> but keep the <hi>Tooth:</hi> of <hi>Trouble,</hi> but keep the <hi>ſin:</hi> of the <hi>evil cauſed,</hi> not of the <hi>evil cauſing.</hi> The <hi>cure</hi> would bee as <hi>deadly</hi> to them as the <hi>wound;</hi> to part with the <hi>ſin,</hi> as to indure the ſmart.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, ſeeing there is a <hi>middle-way</hi> to bee gone, that they may procure their <hi>preſent Peace,</hi> and yet <hi>keep their ſin:</hi> They will go that way, and labour to ſtill the clamours of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> by <hi>bribing it with Duty, feeding it with Prayers;</hi> that ſo they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Peace,</hi> and yet <hi>keep their ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other ends there are, which are more low than the former.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For Ostentation and Pride of Gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A corrupt heart may have the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> though not the <hi>Grace of Prayer;</hi> yea, and bee more eminent therein, than they, who have the <hi>Grace of Prayer.</hi> They may <hi>exceed</hi> others in <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> who yet do <hi>exceed</hi> them in <hi>affections.</hi> And for <hi>Pride, Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in Gifts, A corrupt heart may abound in duties and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For Affection, Credit, eſteem of the World.</hi> That they may bee <hi>accounted holy men;</hi> to have a <hi>Name, they are living,</hi> when yet they are <hi>dead</hi> men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>For the advancement of their worldly deſignes. By this craft they have all their gain.</hi> It may bee <hi>this fills their ſhops, fills their houſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quantas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis divitias.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c. Godlineſs is great gain:</hi> and ſome make a <hi>gain of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are vile wretches, who make God, Religion, holy duties, to ſerve their own baſe ends; who make them but a ſtalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-horſe, the better to purſue their own game, their own gain. Like Water-men, who row one way, but look another. They row towards Heaven in outward works, with the Oar of Religion; but they look towards the World, their own ends, in heart. Their eyes are after their gain. — <hi>Who will ſhew them any good?</hi> Their feet are going toward <hi>Zoar,</hi> with <hi>Lots</hi> Wife; but their heart toward <hi>Sodome.</hi> They ſerve God with their bodies, but Mammon with their ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That by this means, <hi>They might procure Gods bleſsing on them in this life.</hi> Oh! think they, if I do not pray, God will not bleſs mee in my ſhop to day, &amp;c. And therefore do it, to procure Wealth.</p>
                  <p>Wee read the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> (who <hi>denyed that there was any Angel, or Spirit, or Reſurrection;</hi> and ſo by conſequent, <hi>all reward of any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice after this life</hi>) being thereupon demanded, <hi>why they did then keep the Commandements;</hi> they anſwered. — <hi>That it might go well with them in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So there are ſome, whoſe thoughts go no higher, than <hi>that God would bleſs them, God would beſtow upon them theſe belly-bleſsings.</hi> As they <hi>ſell God for gain,</hi> ſo they <hi>ſerve God for gain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With theſe, many other ends might bee laid down, <hi>why a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97371:173"/> heart may abound in outward performances.</hi> But thus much bee ſaid for the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>We have two other things to do more, before wee come to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew you, what are the grounds, that a corrupt heart may ſo abound in outward performance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where the fault is. Or how it comes to paſs, that a man may do thus much in the wayes of God, and yet bee unſound; yet miſs of Heaven at laſt. Wee will begin with the firſt of theſe two, which is the third thing propounded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What the grounds are, whence it ariſeth, that a corrupt heart may abound in outward Performances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt ground is, <hi>Natural Conſcience,</hi> or that <hi>Inbred Light,</hi> which is in the conſcience of men by nature.</p>
                  <p>Every man hath a <hi>Conſcience</hi> in him, and this <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth acknowledge, <hi>that there is a God, one, who is Being of Beings, Cauſe of Cauſes:</hi> and not only ſo, but thereupon, <hi>that this God is to bee worſhiped and ſerved by the Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though Conſcience cannot <hi>diſcover the True God,</hi> or the <hi>True Worſhip;</hi> yet it doth conclude, <hi>there is a God;</hi> and that <hi>this God is to bee worſhiped.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in practice wee have many; every Pariſh is full of them. Such as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. — <hi>Who profeſs they know God, but yet in works they deny him.</hi> But <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in Judgement <hi>none can bee. Hence</hi> Tully <hi>the Heathen could ſay.</hi> — <q>I have known men without King, Laws, Government, Cloaths; but none ſo ſavage, but have a God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many have indeavoured to <hi>blow out that light, but never could.</hi> Wee read of <hi>Caligula,</hi> who laboured all hee could <hi>to blow out this Candle, and to ſtrengthen his Atheiſme by Arguments and Reaſons;</hi> yet when it thundred, hee ran under a Bed; his fears and guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience telling him of ſome divine Power, which hee could not withſtand.</p>
                  <p>Another, who laboured the like; and though hee had wrought out all <hi>Faith,</hi> yet hee had not wrought out all <hi>Fears.</hi> Hee ſtill feared (as hee would ſay) <hi>that there was a God; — And, what if there ſhould prove to bee a God, at last!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then, there being ſuch light in Conſcience, as to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>there is a God:</hi> and conſcience thereupon concluding, <hi>this God muſt bee worſhiped;</hi> by the help of <hi>further light, the Light of the Word, the Light of the Works, the Light of good Example, the Light of good Education,</hi> together with the <hi>implantation of ſome common and general Principles,</hi> whereby conſcience is ſtrengthened from above: <hi>A man may bee inabled to do much in the wayes of godlineſs, and yet his heart continue unſound, without any ſpiritual Principle of Grace wrought in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond ground is, <hi>ſome preſent diſtreſs and trouble upon the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:97371:174"/> Conſcience, or upon the Bodies of men; upon the ſpirit or fleſh of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Some preſent diſtreſs upon the ſpirit of a man.</hi> It may bee Conſcience is now for preſent, <hi>upon the rack.</hi> God hath let in a beam of light into the conſcience, by the Law, and diſcovered a mans ſin. And with that light hath let fall a ſpark of his wrath due to ſin, upon the conſcience; which hath, for preſent, fill'd the ſoul of man with horrors and fears, with ſad and black thoughts and apprehenſions of death and Hell. Which may put a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Prayers, and Performances, upon doing much in the wayes of God.</p>
                  <p>Wee read that <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſent for <hi>Joab</hi> to come to him, but hee came not. Hee ſent again, yet hee comes not. At laſt <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſets fire upon <hi>Joabs</hi> corn; and then hee came amain, but with no better heart: it is likely more unwillingly than before: ſo God doth often call upon men in the miniſtry of the Word; But men will not come. At laſt God ſets fire on the conſcience, lets ſome ſpark of Hell fall upon them. And then they run to <hi>Duties, to Prayers, to do ſomething.</hi> Though perhaps as unwillingly as before. All this doth force them, but yet not perſwade them willingly to come in.</p>
                  <p>As the ſatisfying of conſcience troubled, may bee an end of the performance of many duties: ſo the trouble it ſelf may bee a ground to put them upon performance. As Peace is the end of the Plaiſter, ſo the wound is the ground of it. As Peace is the end of undertaking of duties; ſo the wound is the ground wherefore they are undertaken.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Outward Preſſures upon the bodies of men may bee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground to prevail with unſound hearts, to do much in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſervice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35, 36. — <hi>When the Lord ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned, and inquired early after God. And they remembred that God was their Rock; and the moſt High God their Redeemer.</hi> Here was much.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They return to God;]</hi> That is, <hi>in all outward appearance. They ſought him, they inquired early after him.</hi> And the ground of this was <hi>Gods hand upon them; when the Lord ſlew them</hi>] ſaith the Text.</p>
                  <p>And you ſee what was the frame of their ſpirit in all. — <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe they did but flatter him; their hearts were not upright with him:</hi> they were <hi>unſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like wee read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.27. They gave God their backs, and not their faces; yet in the time of their trouble, then who but God with them. — <hi>In the time of their trouble, then they cry, ariſe and ſave us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was like the <hi>Samaritans Devotion. When the Lions ſlew them,</hi> then they inquired after the <hi>worſhip of God,</hi> when God ſent Lions among them.</p>
                  <p>And many there are of their ſpirit. <hi>Good under the Rod.</hi> Whiles
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:97371:174"/> the Rod is on their backs, the Book is in their hands; then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but read and pray. But no ſooner doth God ſlacken the cords or take them off the rack, deliver them out of their preſent diſtreſs and trouble, but they return again to folly.</p>
                  <p>This is juſt <hi>Mariners Devotion.</hi> Whilſt the <hi>Storm laſts, then they cry and pray;</hi> but no ſooner is the ſtorm blown over, but they are <hi>as vile as ever.</hi> They had not ſo many Prayers before, as Oathes now.</p>
                  <p>And do wee not ſee it thus with many? who will not <hi>own God in a Calm.</hi> Then their hearts ſay — <hi>depart from us, wee deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes.</hi> Yet in a <hi>Storm</hi> they will flye to him — <hi>thou art our Father, our God.</hi> But this not for <hi>Love,</hi> but for <hi>ſhelter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As many a man may bee glad of a place for ſhelter in a <hi>Storm,</hi> which they could never brook to live in after the ſtorm is over. So they will own God a Tower, a place of ſhelter in time of trouble; but not an habitation, a place of abode, in times of Peace. Thus you ſee the third thing. <hi>The grounds, that a corrupt heart may ſo abound in outward Performance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth remains, which is</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Where is the fault.</hi> Or <hi>how comes it to paſs,</hi> that a man may do thus much in the wayes of God, and yet bee <hi>unſound,</hi> yet miſs of Heaven. <hi>Where lies the fault?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conceive, though the work it ſelf bee faulty: (for how can a <hi>good work come from a bad heart?</hi>) Yet the great crack lies more in the Work-man, than in the work. Duties are good, Prayer is good, Hearing good. The fault doth mainly lye in the Perſon that doth theſe. Their ſpirits are unſound in theſe holy wayes.</p>
                  <p>I will lay down the maim, the fault under theſe five or ſix Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee fails,</hi> or is <hi>faulty in the latitude and extent of his Obedience.</hi> His <hi>Obedience</hi> is a <hi>limited and ſtinted Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either <hi>limited to ſome commands,</hi> which are moſt ſutable to him. Hee doth not apply himſelf to the <hi>Obedience of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God.</hi> There are <hi>ſome duties hee will not do, and ſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hee hath no heart to leave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or ſecondly, <hi>It is limited to the fleſh,</hi> to the <hi>outer part of the Command,</hi> and doth not extend it ſelf to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Command of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt know, there is an <hi>Extra,</hi> and an <hi>Intra;</hi> an <hi>Outſide,</hi> and an <hi>Inſide</hi> in every <hi>Command of God:</hi> ſome part of it binding the Fleſh, another part injoyning the Spirit. Many keep the Letter of the Law, which yet never care for the Spirit of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe you ſhall ſee in the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They did ſomething, yea they did much. <hi>They faſted, they prayed, they paid Tithes of all that they had, &amp;c.</hi> But they did not all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There were other Commands, which they gave liberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in. They could <hi>oppreſs, defraud, bee unjust.</hi> And they failed in the</p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:97371:175"/>
                  <p>Second too, That their Obedience did not extend it ſelf to the ſpiritualneſs of any command. As you ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> chargeth them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.21. They did not <hi>Murder;</hi> they did not <hi>commit Adultery;</hi> but they gave way to <hi>Unjuſt Anger,</hi> to <hi>Adulterous Thoughts, Unchaſt Glances, Contemplative Wickedneſs, Speculative Uncleanneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo in all the reſt. This is the firſt maim in his Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hee is faulty in the <hi>Manner of his Obedience.</hi> Though for the <hi>Matter of his Obedience,</hi> hee do not fail; Hee doth <hi>Pray, Hear, do Duties</hi> which others do, yet hee is faulty in the <hi>Manner</hi> of his Obedience. Hee doth not <hi>pray in Faith, pray with affections.</hi> Hee <hi>confeſſeth ſin;</hi> but a broken ſpirit doth not run through the <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin:</hi> His heart is never touched with ſin. Hee prayes for Grace, but his ſpirit is never touched with the <hi>Beauties of Grace,</hi> nor carryed after it with deſires for it. Hee looks perhaps to the <hi>Matter,</hi> but neglects the <hi>Manner.</hi> Hee looks after the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but neglects the <hi>Circumſtances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the difference between the <hi>groſs Hypocrite,</hi> and the <hi>cloſe Hypocrite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>groſs Hypocrite</hi> looks after the <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> not after the <hi>Substance.</hi> Though indeed they are not ſuch <hi>Circumſtances</hi> as theſe are: they are but <hi>outward,</hi> not <hi>inward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>cloſe Hypocrite,</hi> hee looks after the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> but neglects the <hi>Circumſtances.</hi> Hee prayes, but never mindes to pray in <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a man <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>pray not fervently;</hi> if hee <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>hear not faithfully;</hi> if hee <hi>obey,</hi> and <hi>obey not willingly;</hi> if hee <hi>ſhew Mercy,</hi> and <hi>not chearfully;</hi> if hee <hi>keep the Sabbath,</hi> and not with <hi>delight;</hi> all his ſervices are nothing worth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hee is faulty in his <hi>Aims</hi> and <hi>Ends:</hi> His <hi>Ends</hi> are corrupt. His <hi>Aime</hi> is as his <hi>own Ends,</hi> his <hi>own Profit, Gain, Pride. Oſtentation. Himſelf is the end of his Obedience,</hi> ſome way or other.</p>
                  <p>A man never wrought out of himſelf, muſt needs work to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And obedience which ariſeth from a mans ſelf, is termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a mans ſelf again. It muſt bee a Principle from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which carries the ſoul to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> A man can go no higher than his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And therefore having Principles no higher than himſelf, his Obedience muſt needs bee terminated in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>As all <hi>Rivers,</hi> they run to the Sea. They came from the Sea, and therefore return back again to the Sea; ſo all thoſe duties which ariſe from a mans ſelf, muſt needs bee finiſhed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Such a man, hee is <hi>the God himſelf</hi> whom hee ſerves. Hee makes himſelf the end of all his ſervice: though hee look as far as the end, even to Heaven in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Here then is the third thing wherein hee is faulty. <hi>Hee makes himſelf the end of all his Obedience. Hee hath not a ſingle Eye to the Glory of God.</hi> His ſervice is neither <hi>begun in God, nor wrought by
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:97371:175"/> God, nor finiſhed to God.</hi> Neither begun by his <hi>Grace,</hi> nor <hi>finiſhed</hi> to his <hi>Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hee is faulty in this, that <hi>hee reſts upon what hee doth, and looks no higher.</hi> Hee looks upon all hee doth as upon ſo many <hi>bribes</hi> for a <hi>pardon,</hi> as ſo much <hi>good monies laid out for Heaven.</hi> Hee weaves a web of Righteouſneſs to cloathe himſelf withall. Hee never looks out for <hi>another Righteouſneſs,</hi> to bee juſtified by; but reſts upon that which hee himſelf hath wrought. Which being not only <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,</hi> but <hi>impure;</hi> a <hi>rag,</hi> and a <hi>filthy rag:</hi> hee muſt needs miſcarry in it.</p>
                  <p>If this had been enough to have brought men to Heaven, God might have ſpared a great deal of labour, <hi>Chriſt</hi> a great deal of blood, by giving man ability to do duties; and then all had been done.</p>
                  <p>But there was an infinit wrath to bee born; an infinite juſtice to bee ſatisfied; which none but <hi>Chriſt</hi> can do.</p>
                  <p>And here you ſee the Scribes and Phariſees failed alſo. They did much, but they looked out for <hi>no other Righteouſneſs than their own; In this they reſted for Life and Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They make <hi>duty it ſelf their Obedience, which ſhould quicken their Obedience.</hi> They reſt upon the <hi>bare performance of the duty,</hi> and never look to the <hi>end of Duty.</hi> So they reſt upon the bridge, and never go over.</p>
                  <p>Duty ſerves an unſound ſpirit for Obedience. But Duty doth but quicken, and ſtrengthen, and inable a godly man to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But the ſixth, and the main Crack is here. <hi>Theſe ſpiritual Performances do not ariſe from ſpiritual Principles; from an heart prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled from above; from an heart univerſally ſanctified.</hi> Here is the <hi>Bane of all.</hi> Here are <hi>new works,</hi> but an <hi>old heart. New Practiſes;</hi> but a mans <hi>old Principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10. to 16. But I will now inſtance in the fifteenth only. — <hi>When you ſpread forth your hands to Heaven, I will hide my eyes; and when you make many Prayers;</hi> when you <hi>abound in duty, adding Prayer to Prayer</hi> (as the Word is) — <hi>I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.</hi> They were <hi>unregenerate, unſanctified.</hi> They were <hi>new practiſes,</hi> but the <hi>old heart</hi> ſtill.</p>
                  <p>The like you ſee of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> They <hi>faſted, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did much</hi> in the wayes of God. But their hearts were not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were unregenerate ſtill, were not principled from above.</p>
                  <p>This you ſee plain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. where <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> one of the chief of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> knew not yet what <hi>Regeneration</hi> meant. <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells him of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> and hee replies, <hi>How is it poſsible that a man ſhould bee born again, when hee is old? Can hee enter into his Mothers womb again?</hi> By which you ſee, though hee <hi>did all thoſe things</hi> reported of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as <hi>Faſting, Praying, Tithing, &amp;c.</hi> yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s hee a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to this <hi>great work of Regeneration, change of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:97371:176"/> Nature;</hi> hee knew not what it meant.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee, here is the great fault of all. A man walks in <hi>new Practiſes</hi> with an <hi>old Heart,</hi> an <hi>Heart</hi> never <hi>truly, throughly, ſpiritually changed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a fourefold <hi>Change.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>A change from good to evil.</hi> This is a fearfull <hi>change.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>I will expreſs it in theſe four words. There is
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>A Moral Change.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>A Partial Change.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>A Formal Change.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>A Spiritual Change.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a meer Moral Change.</hi> When a man changeth from ſinfull notorious wayes, to <hi>Morality, Temperance, Juſtice, Equity, Patience, Contentation.</hi> And ſticks there, and goes no further. And here thouſands, who lye in the boſome of the Church, ſtick and periſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Partial Change;</hi> wherein men leave ſome particular ſins, and practiſe ſome particular duties. This is a particular Converſion. When men were Drunkards, Swearers, unclean perſons, &amp;c. And now are perſwaded to leave theſe particular ſins, and betake themſelves to ſome general and common duties of a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>And there are many men, who are mended thus. They will hear a Sermon, and do ſome outward duties, But they are not new made. And this is but like the putting of a new peece of cloath into an old garment; the rent will bee made worſe. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſets this down in the parable. The unclean ſpirit is caſt out for a time, but afterward returneth with ſeven ſpirits worſe than himſelf, and ſo his laſt end proves worſe than his beginning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>Formal Change,</hi> when men, in <hi>outward appearance</hi> do ſeem to walk in all duties of holineſs, and to forbear the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any groſs ſin. And yet never had their hearts wrought upon. All this while it is but their practiſes, not their Principles that are truly changed. And theſe are the men that do ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Having a form of godlineſs, yet denying the Power: From ſuch turn away.</hi> By which phraſe, I told you, was implied, that though an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> hath nothing in him, which is <hi>eſſential</hi> to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> yet may hee bee the <hi>compleat Reſemblance of a Chriſtian,</hi> in all thoſe things which are not <hi>eſſential</hi> to him. Hee may bee the <hi>compleat picture of a godly man,</hi> from top, to toe; in every member, every limb, every duty, for the <hi>externals</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a <hi>Spiritual Change;</hi> wherein the <hi>frame and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>inward man</hi> is <hi>changed;</hi> and <hi>all is made new.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:97371:176"/>1. <hi>Not new, for ſubſtance of ſoul and body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Not new, for faculties of ſoul and body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>new underſtanding, new will, &amp;c.</hi> Here a mans <hi>new Practiſes</hi> flow from <hi>new Principles.</hi> Here are not only <hi>new Wayes,</hi> but here is a <hi>new Heart.</hi> Hee hath a <hi>new Life in him,</hi> a <hi>new Spirit in him,</hi> by which hee is moved, And the want of this is <hi>the great Crack, the great Fault, the Ground,</hi> why a man may do much in the wayes of God, and yet miſcarry at laſt.</p>
                  <p>But there will bee one great Objection, which ſeems to throw down all this. The Objection is this.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Nature cannot act, ultra Sphaeram, above it ſelf. Nature cannot go any further than Nature.</hi> As wee ſay of the <hi>Water. Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum deſcendit, tantum aſcendit. Water can riſe no higher than it falls.</hi> So may it bee ſaid of <hi>Nature: Nature cannot act above Nature: cannot act above her Principle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>to do theſe things is above the power of Nature. Therefore, hee who doth theſe duties, is above a ſtate of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer of this. Wee ſay it is true in the Main. A man that hath no more than <hi>meer Nature</hi> in him, cannot <hi>act above meer Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Nature may bee ſtrengthened from above.</hi> There may bee <hi>higher Principles ſet in Nature,</hi> which may <hi>inable</hi> a man to <hi>go higher</hi> than <hi>common Nature,</hi> though not yet above one in <hi>ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man may bee <hi>inabled to act above Nature:</hi> yet the <hi>Principle</hi> is not <hi>ſo high,</hi> as to <hi>inable a man to act above a man in the State of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better clearing of this. Wee may conſider <hi>Nature in diverſe forms or ranks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is <hi>meer Nature; with thoſe reliques</hi> (as ſome ſay) But rather (I ſay) <hi>reſtored Principles,</hi> which God gave to man, after hee had loſt all; that hee might bee a <hi>Man, not a Devil.</hi> For when by ſin, wee had loſt all, if God had not, out of pitty to mankinde, reſtored ſomething, wee ſhould have been as bad as Devils in the world; one devoure, murther, commit all outrage upon another. Now in this ſtate, ſomething may bee done, not much.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is nature civilized, and moralized.</hi> Nature refined by <hi>moral Principles,</hi> which whether they bee in nature before, and ſo but husbanded and improved; or whether they were ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of the Spirit, wee will not now diſpute, but conclude this latter.</p>
                  <p>Now by theſe a man may bee inabled to do above the common ſort of men, hee having higher Principles than meer nature fallen, and therefore is able to do more, in all the works of morality, works of Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Charity, &amp;c.</p>

                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:97371:177"/>3. <hi>There is Nature ſublimated,</hi> and raiſed yet higher by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation of higher Principles than theſe are, by the help of which, a man may bee inabled to do above the pureſt natures of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; and yet but Nature.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> of <hi>Grace, Heaven, Hell,</hi> together with the implantation of ſome general Principles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts and graces of the Spirit may ſo ſublimate a man, that by the help of theſe, a man may not only bee wrought up to do more than meer Nature fallen, but more than Nature ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with moral Principles, is able to do.</p>
                  <p>You ſee this in <hi>Judas, Demas, Herod, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe actions were above meer Nature, as comming from higher Principles; but yet not above men in the ſtate of Nature.</p>

                  <p>There may bee a ſupernatural work of the Spirit, upon ſome men, whereby nature may bee ſtrengthened from above; and yet they may want the ſaving work of the Spirit.</p>

                     <p>But (alas!) You ſee it is poſſible for a man to abound in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet his heart bee unſound. And therefore the doing of theſe things will not bee ſufficient to evidence to your ſelves, that your condition is good.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Anchors ſhould ever hold, you need not to beat out any better Anchors for your ſouls. But ſeeing theſe do not hold out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, you had need ſeek out for better. Elſe you may miſcarry at laſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe may hold in a Calm, when they are put to no ſtreſs; but will bee ſure to break in a ſtorm.

It is a <hi>Righteouſneſs revealed from Faith, to Faith.</hi> The <hi>more Faith,</hi> not the <hi>leſſe,</hi> but the more <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is diſcovered.</hi> And as it cannot bee <hi>over-claſped by any Faith;</hi> ſo it cannot bee <hi>exceeded by any ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee <hi>Evidences</hi> from our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> they are the <hi>cleareſt Evidences;</hi> the <hi>freeſt</hi> from <hi>diſputes:</hi> and if any Objections do ariſe, they may bee the more quickly laid.</p>
                     <p>But now it is not ſo with other kinde of <hi>Evidences.</hi> If a man take an <hi>Evidence from Duty,</hi> there will bee <hi>controverſies: Objection</hi> upon <hi>Objection</hi> will ariſe: and there muſt bee <hi>Evidence</hi> upon that <hi>Evidence,</hi> before ever a man can make out the truth of them. Nay, though <hi>Evidences</hi> bee taken from <hi>Graces</hi> themſelves, yet you will ſcarce finde a <hi>bottome</hi> without much ſearch.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe a man come to bring in <hi>his Love to Christ</hi> for an <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> yet this is liable to diſpute. You know, there is a <hi>Falſe-Love,</hi> as well as a <hi>True,</hi> a <hi>counterfeit,</hi> as well as a <hi>ſound.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this muſt bee examined by the <hi>Nature of your Love,</hi> the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your Love</hi> towards <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the <hi>expreſsions of your Love in all the wayes of Obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I muſt tell you of <hi>great latitude and extent in this tryal.</hi> There will bee <hi>long debates,</hi> before you come to the <hi>utmoſt.</hi> And the like I may ſay of <hi>any Grace</hi> beſides. Therefore theſe from <hi>Juſtification</hi> are the <hi>cleareſt Evidences</hi> from diſputes and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</p>

                     <p>You know, there is <hi>much deadneſs</hi> with our <hi>chiefeſt Life, much formality in our beſt Power; much coldneſs with our heats: much of the fleſh in all the imployments of the ſpirit.</hi>

                     <p>I ſay, theſe <hi>Evidences</hi> are <hi>pure,</hi> without <hi>mixture,</hi> becauſe they are ſuch, as have <hi>nothing of our own in them:</hi> had they any thing of ours, they would bee imperfect and impure: but having nothing of ours, but <hi>all Chriſts,</hi> they are altogether perfect and pure. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>all fair, all perfect, all pure.</hi>

                        <hi>Our ſanctifying Righteouſneſs is ſtained, imperfect, impure; but our justifying Righteouſneſs is pure and perfect.</hi> If there were any ſtain or any imperfection in that, it could not juſtifie, it could not ſave us; wee ſhould bee undone for ever. But that is pure, that is perfect, and wee in it. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. — <hi>In him wee are compleat. Compleat in him,</hi> though <hi>imperfect in our ſelves.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe are the moſt ſatisfying Evidences.</hi> Other Evidences ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of much queſtionings.

                     <p>If <hi>Chriſt</hi> bee not a <hi>compleat Satisfier of Gods Wrath and Juſtice</hi> for our ſins, then theſe Evidences from the <hi>Satisfaction of Chriſt</hi> would do mee no good.

                     </p>
                     <p>So that you ſee, theſe are ſuch Evidences, as do not <hi>only quiet,</hi> but <hi>ſatisfie</hi> conſcience to the <hi>full.</hi> Such as <hi>ſilence all doubts; anſwer all ſcruples and objections,</hi> that do ariſe.</p>
                     <p>Other Evidences; they are not <hi>ſo full,</hi> not <hi>ſo ſatisfactory.</hi> They may afford a man <hi>ſome obvious Refreſhment,</hi> for a time, to hold up the head from <hi>ſinking;</hi> but they bring not <hi>fulneſs of ſatisfaction</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>But now <hi>this doth;</hi> becauſe you ſee it is taken from <hi>ſuch things wherein God himſelf is ſatisfied;</hi> and therefore no reaſon but <hi>wee ſhould bee ſatisfied.</hi> If the <hi>Creditor</hi> ſay <hi>enough,</hi> ſhall not the <hi>Debtor bee ſatisfied?</hi>

                     <p>I might inlarge my ſelf, and go yet further to tell you theſe are the ſweeteſt, the moſt refreſhing and comforting evidences.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude this uſe. <hi>If ever you would have ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if ever you would have a full and ſetled peace and comfort, then hence draw your Evidences, fetch your Evidences from Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>

                     <p>I know, that which keeps you upon the racks of fears, that which continues you in doubts and jealouſies, is this. You take your Evidences too low, either from ſomething in you, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done by you, and ſo you are forced to anſwer a multitude of Objections and reaſons, before ever you can finde a bottome to reſt upon.</p>
                     <p>That which doth raiſe up new doubts and objections in your ſpirits, and which cauſeth a freſh return of fears upon you, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you do not take your Evidences high enough.</p>
                     <p>You take them from Duties, Prayers, Diſpoſitions, preſent Affections. And ſo upon every failing you are caſt, and all thrown down again, new fears ariſe, as if you never had any Evidence.</p>
                     <p>Were an Evidence ſealed in the higher Court, what Court ſhall diſpute againſt it, what can overthrow it?</p>
                     <p>But now if all this will not perſwade you to fetch your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences higher, but that you will ſtill lye by theſe waters for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, you will ſtill fetch your Comforts and Evidences from Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet let mee thus far perſwade with you, that you would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to clear the ſincerity of your heart in theſe duties.

                     <p>They are but uncertain bottomes at the beſt, but without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to accompany them they will bee no bottomes, an houſe not built on the Sand, but built in the Air, no foundation.</p>

                     <p>Wee will give you theſe characters of a ſincere heart in hearing the Word.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A ſincere heart deſires ſincere preaching. Such preaching wherein his heart is ripped up; his corruptions diſcovered; the moſt quickening and ſoul-ſearching miniſtry; ſuch a miniſtry as doth moſt unravel his heart, and rip up his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>You ſee this, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word,</hi> the preaching of the Word, and the ſincere preaching of the Word, not the Word as it is ſophiſticated, poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, adulterated by mans invention. As the Apoſtles phraſe is, but the Word as it comes ſincerely from the Fountain.</p>
                     <p>Such a man hee deſires killing, as well as comforting truths, ſearching, as well as healing truthes; breaking, as well as binding. And indeed, hee deſires no comforting, but in killing; no comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his ſoul, but in killing of his ſins; no healing, but in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; no binding, but in breaking.</p>
                     <p>An unſound heart, if hee deſire to hear, yet it ſhould bee ſuch as would preach <hi>placentia,</hi> ſpeak peace, daube with untempered Morter.</p>
                     <p>And if a Miniſter do once preach to the quick. If hee once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the diſcovery of them, their hearts riſe againſt the truth; they rebel againſt the Word; and ſuch are no Miniſters for them. They will finde out one that they can live in ſin, and yet live in peace under his Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>We read in the 42. of <hi>Jer.</hi> read it throughout, (the Chapter is worth your taking notice of.) Let mee intreat you to read it when you come home, you ſhall ſee there the depth of a ſelf-deceiving ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall read there, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſired <hi>Jeremy</hi> to inquire of the Lord what they ſhould do, and they would aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it; but their hearts deceived them. You ſee there that they thought <hi>Jeremy</hi> would have brought them an anſwer from
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:97371:182"/> God agreeable to their own ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>They did not think that their will muſt have come up to Gods will, but that Gods will would have come down to their will.</p>
                     <p>Well, <hi>Jeremy</hi> goes to God, and hee brings them a meſſage from God which was clean croſs to their luſts. And then the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of their ſpirits which before lay hid, appeared, they brake out into open rebellion againſt the Word of the Lord, and ſpake plain. Wee will not hear the Word of the Lord which thou haſt told us.</p>
                     <p>So it is with many unſound ſpirits, ſelf-deceiving ſpirits; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Miniſter come into a Pariſh. Oh then ſay they! let us have a good Miniſter, one that may do our ſouls good, one that may bring a meſſage to us from the Lord, diſcover to us Gods will. And few there are but do thus far agree; but if once a Miniſter rip up their ſins, ſearch their wounds, that they may bee healed of them: if once hee come to diſcover their corruptions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take them off their unſound bottomes; whereon if they live and dye, they will periſh. Then they flye out againſt the light, and him that holds it forth to them. Away with ſuch a man from the earth. Wee will not hear the Word of the Lord ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Whereas a ſincere heart doth ſide with the Word, with light, to fight againſt and deſtroy his corruptions.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men they ſide with their corruptions and luſts, to fight againſt the truth, to blow out the light, and oppoſe the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</p>
                     <p>A ſincere heart doth hold up the Law againſt his luſt. Let my luſts periſh, rather than thy Law bee deſtroyed. But a corrupt heart doth hold up his luſt againſt the Law. And ſaith in his heart, Let the Law rather than my luſt bee deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>There is not one corruption which thou keepeſt with love and liking, but thou wiſheſt in thy heart, that there were no ſuch Law againſt it. The Drunkard wiſheth there were no ſuch Law againſt his Drunkenneſs. The unclean perſon would bee glad there were no Law againſt his uncleanneſs, rather part with ſo much of Gods Nature, which the Law is a beam of, than part with his luſt.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is truly ſaid, <hi>peccatum eſt Dei Cidium;</hi> ſin is Gods ſlaughter, becauſe ſin ſtrikes againſt the very being of God; the purity and holineſs of God.</p>
                     <p>Hee that would not bee as God is, would hee glad if God were as hee is. That is a certain rule, that hee that will favour himſelf in any corruption, would bee glad if God would favour him too. That there were no Law againſt it, or that there were a Law to countenance it, or no Law to puniſh it. That God were not againſt it, that God were of his mind, or that there were no God, or no God to puniſh it, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Hee receives the truth not into his head only, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know it, but into his heart, his affections to love it.</p>
                     <p>Hee doth not impriſon it in the head, but lets it go down into the heart. And the whole ſoul is made the reſidence and place of truth. <hi>Lord how I love thy Law</hi> contrary hereto is that, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hee is willing to receive every truth: Speak Lord, for thy Servant heareth. Hee looks upon every word of God as good, every truth of God, as comming in the image of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with the authority of God, and there is ready entertainment for all; as well thoſe which make againſt him, as thoſe which make for him; though a truth appear never ſo formidable that the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving may coſt a man death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hee is willing to receive truth, as the truth; that is, in the Power, Majeſty and Authority of Truth, And ſets it up as King in his ſpirit. To which hee deſires to yeeld ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all.</p>
                     <p>Hee lets it come in, in its inlightening, in its convincing power; in its humbling and awakening power, as well as in its quickening and comforting power.</p>
                     <p>Every truth ſhall bee received as the truth of God.</p>
                     <p>But now an unſound ſpirit</p>
                     <p>Hee is not willing to receive the truth; ſome truth hee dare not own, leaſt they ſhould diſturb him in a way of ſin. As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Of this they are willingly ignorant;</hi> they have no deſire to know this. They deſire to ſhut out the light, that their corruptions may not bee diſquieted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. They wink with their eyes, that they might not underſtand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They receive not every Truth. It may bee ſuch as are notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal they will, or ſuch as may ſtand with their luſts and preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; not ſuch as are practical, and croſs them in their corrupt ends and practiſes.</p>
                     <p>They look upon ſome truthes, as an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> that if they ſhould entertain them, and follow them, they would lead them into danger.</p>
                     <p>It was the ſpeech of a King of <hi>France,</hi> that hee would lanch no further into the deep, than hee might come ſafely to ſhore. That is, hee would follow Truth no further, than hee may preſerve himſelf and his own. If thoſe bee hazarded, hee will forſake the Truth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They receive it not as Truth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not for it ſelf. 2. Not to bee King over them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not for it ſelf, but for other private and perſonal reſpects. Either for their gain, their advantage, or for fear and danger, or
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:97371:183"/> out of reſpects to the greatneſs, or quality of the perſons, who do entertain a Truth.</p>
                     <p>Whereas a godly man doth love the perſon for the Truths ſake. As St. <hi>John</hi> writing to the Elect Lady, whom hee ſaid hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Truths ſake, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                     <p>They that love the Truth for the perſons ſake, may ſay they love the Truth for the Ladies ſake. The one the perſon for the Truths ſake, the other the truth for the perſons ſake.</p>
                     <p>So you ſee they receive it not as Truth for it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They receive it not as Truth to bee Lord and King over them. To which they yeeld obedience and ſubjection in all things.</p>
                     <p>Many men would govern Truth, but they will not ſuffer Truth to govern them. They would keep Truth, though but in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for all their keeping is but impriſoning, but they will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Truth to keep them, though the Truth would make them free. Corrupt ſpirits they receive Truth as a Servant, not as a King. And before they receive it, they will ask what it can do for them; what ſervice, what advantage can it bring them? If none, Truth ſhall not bee entertained of them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A ſincere heart in hearing the Word, is an honeſt heart: and there is the ſumme of all.</p>
                     <p>This Chriſt expreſſeth in the Parable of the Sower and the Seed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.15. the ſincere ſpirit received the Word with an honeſt and good heart.</p>
                     <p>Now the honeſty of a mans ſpirit in hearing, or an honeſt heart in hearing, is ſuch as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Hears the Word, as Gods Word, bee the inſtrument never ſo weak and deſpicable, yet it ſhall prevail with an honeſt heart, becauſe it is Gods Word. You have an expreſſion in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6. <hi>A little Childe ſhall lead him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whoever comes with a meſſage from God, whoever brings a word, hee ſhall prevail and perſwade with him.</p>
                     <p>An honeſt ſervant will take notice of his Maſters mind, though a Child bee the meſſenger; hee looks not on the perſon that brings it, but on the meſſage brought. So though the perſon bee never ſo weak, if hee bring a word from God, an honeſt heart will vail to it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. An honeſt heart ſides with the Word of God againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hee takes part with a truth againſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Whereas an unſound heart ſides with his corruption againſt the Word, fights againſt that which fights againſt it; but an honeſt heart ſides with the Word againſt his corruption.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An honeſt heart deſires to profit by the Word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new born Babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby.</hi> Hee is a man that is reſolved to practiſe whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God reveals. Hee hath no exceptions or reſervations to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:97371:183"/> but is bent to practiſe every Truth God reveals to him. Hee asketh the way to <hi>Sion</hi> with his face thitherward, as one reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go the way that God ſhall reveal.</p>
                     <p>This was that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have mee to do?</hi> They were not <hi>verba expoſtulantis,</hi> but <hi>verba ſubmittentis.</hi> Hee was not only deſirous to know, but reſolved to do whatever God did reveale to him.</p>
                     <p>An honeſt heart deſires every Truth to bee made his own. And that there may bee Principles bred in the ſpirit ſutable to the Truthes revealed to him. Hee is deſirous that every degree of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination may bee a further degree of ſanctification. That his heart may bee transformed into the nature of truthes revealed.</p>
                     <p>It doth not content him to have truthes in the head, and a lye in the heart: Truth in the head, and error in the ſpirit: Light in the head, and darkneſs in the heart, but hee deſires the whole man may bee digeſted into the nature of truthes. Truth formed in his ſoul.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An honeſt heart, hee hears the word with reflection. As in reading the word, hee reads himſelf with it. So in hearing the word, hee doth peruſe himſelf with it. Hee hears with reflection, hee hears with application, charging and clearing his heart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the evidence which conſcience gives in upon hearing of the Word.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Clear the ſincerity of your hearts in matter of praying. I told you in the beginning that it was poſſible for a man to pray, nay and make many prayers, to abound in praying; hee may pray in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, pray in private, pray in the Church, and pray in his cloſet, hee may multiply to pray, as the word importeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. And yet his heart bee unſound. And therefore, you, who do abound much in prayer, labour to clear the ſincerity of your hearts in this duty.</p>
                     <p>Wee will give you theſe Characters of an heart ſincere in Prayer.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Where the heart is ſincere in Prayer, there is a doing of the duty with all our ſtrength.</hi> There will bee a laying out of all the ſtrength and powers within us. The ſtrength of our Judgement, the ſtrength of our will, and our affections; the ſtrength of the whole ſoul in the work. Prayer when ſincere, is a wreſtling work. <hi>Jacob wreſtled with God;</hi> that is, hee wept and prayed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. Prayer is the ſouls contention, the ſouls ſtrugling with God.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſweating work. It is the ſweat and blood of the ſoul. A ſincere heart layes out its ſtrength in prayer.</p>
                     <p>Though a mans ſtrength bee but weakneſs, yet if a mans ſtrength bee in the work, it is ſufficient to evidence a mans ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Indeed if a man had a Male in his flock, and ſhould offer to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97371:184"/> the Lord a female. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ee had a better, and ſhould give God a worſe. If hee had ſtrength, and yet ſerved the Lord with weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; this would declare the heart to bee unſound.</p>
                     <p>But when a mans ſtrength is in the work, though that ſtrength bee but weakneſs, yet it will evidence the ſincerity of the heart. And there is no reaſon that you ſhould look upon thoſe Prayers as caſt, as loſt Prayers, where your ſtrength is in them.</p>
                     <p>When thou haſt been with God, and performed a duty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though but weakly, many imperfections in it, much unbeleef, much hardneſs, much deadneſs and coldneſs; yet if your ſtrength have been in the duty, you may riſe up without confuſion and ſhame, upon this ground, your ſtrength hath been in it, your heart doth not condemn you, you are able to clear this to your ſpirit; your ſtrength hath been in the work.</p>
                     <p>But now ſuch are here condemned, and caſt, who have a Male in their flock, and offer to the Lord a Female. God curſeth ſuch. <hi>Curſed, &amp;c.</hi> Mal. 1.14. When you have ſtrength, and ſerve God with weakneſs; when you will turn off God with your cold, your lazy, ſleepy, and formal devotions, and will not take any pains with your own hearts in theſe holy works. This diſcovers your ſpirits to bee unſound, and falſe to God.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A ſincere heart in Prayer, is an heart-ſincerity in Prayer, not a tongue in Prayer, not an head in Prayer, but an heart in Prayer.</p>
                     <p>Prayer is not lip-work, or head work, but heart work. And where the heart is ſincere, hee is not content till the heart bee in the work. Hee is not content to bee down on his knees, if his heart bee not up. To have an hand in the work; if his heart bee not alſo in it.</p>
                     <p>A ſincere heart labours to get his heart into the work. Hee prayes in prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17. There is an affective collation with the duty. If hee confeſſeth ſins, hee deſireth to get affections ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the confeſſion of ſin. An heart wounded and broken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſight and ſenſe of ſin.</p>
                     <p>If hee prayes for pardon, hee labours to get an heart apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the want, and alſo of the worth of mercy; and ſeeks a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as a condemned man a pardon.</p>
                     <p>If hee pray for Grace, or the ſubduing of luſts, ſtill hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to get an heart ſutable to the things hee wants, and that which hee doth deſire.</p>
                     <p>It was the ſpeech of <hi>Bradford,</hi> that hee would never leave a duty till hee had brought his heart into the frame of the duty. Hee would not leave confeſſion of ſin, till his heart was broken for ſin. Hee would not leave petitioning for Grace, till his heart was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:97371:184"/> in deſire. He would not leave gratulation, till his heart was inlarged with the ſenſe of the mercies he enjoyed, and quickned in the return of praiſe.</p>
                     <p>But now an unſound heart, if hee can but poſt over a duty. If but ſay his prayers, though hee have never laboured to get his heart into them, yet he is well enough.</p>
                     <p>This is to draw neer with our lips, when yet our hearts are far from God, This is to offer God a bulk and carkaſs of duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the life and ſpirit of duty, and ſo it is abominable to God.</p>
                     <p>A body without a ſoul ſtinks; ſo here, your Confeſſions of ſins, are Commiſſions of ſins, Iterations of ſins, when your hearts are not ſenſible and affected with ſinnes you confeſſe. Hee that remembers ſinne with delight, doth commit the ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>He that remembers ſin without ſorrow, doth but revive his former guilt, hee removes it not; A man may diſpleaſe a man as much with the Confeſſion of a fault, as in the Commiſſion of the fault.</p>
                     <p>If a man had offended you, and ſhould come in a ſleight way to confeſs his fault, you would be more offended at him for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, than for his fault.</p>
                     <p>So when you ſhall come before God and confeſs your ſins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any compunction for your ſinnes, without any ſenſe of ſin, or ſorrow for it, you do aggravate your ſins, and increaſe guilt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of removing guilt from your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>An hard heart, and a dry eye in the confeſſion of ſin, is an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your ſins.</p>

                     <p>Others they make duty the end of duty, prayer the end of prayer; And therefore if they can but rid their hands of a duty, though they had no communion with God in it, yet they are well enough.</p>
                     <p>But now a ſincere heart, hee looks above a duty, hee looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on duty but as a bridge to convey him over to God; as a means to bring God and his ſoul into neerer communion, and if yee have not ſeen God, and found God in a duty, if his ſpirit hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with God as a Father, as a friend, as a child with his father, as a man with his friend, he hath no content in duty.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the anſwer of this, I muſt firſt tell you, that there is a great miſtake among men and women, of a tender ſpirit about this point, that they think they have no communion with God, unles they have met with God in an heart-chearing, and an heart-comforting way, when God comes in with joy, with comfort, with chearings and inlargements. Then they are willing to grant you, they have had communion with God.</p>
                     <p>But if God have come in, in an heart breaking, humbling, and caſting down their ſouls in the ſight and ſence of their ſinnes, and imperfections, They do not think they have Communion with God.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I muſt tell you firſt in the general; That you may have Communion with God, as well in an heart humbling, as an heart reviving, an heart Comforting way.</p>
                     <p>In the life to come in heaven, all our Communion with God is with Comfort, with fulneſs of joy, <hi>At his right hand is fulneſſe, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 16.11. with thee there is a fountain of joy. Then all tears ſhall bee wiped away from our eyes.</p>
                     <p>But in this life on earth, we have mixed communion; and have communion with God, as well in humblings, as in comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                     <p>You go upon a duty, and you think to meet God one way, and hee comes in another way.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes you expect God in a comforting, and God comes in, in a quickning way.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes thou expects God in an heart breaking way, and God comes in, in a comforting way.</p>
                     <p>As the wind, ſometimes it blows up rain, ſometimes it blows away rain.</p>
                     <p>So the Spirit of God, which bloweth where, and when, and how it liſteth; ſometimes blows up rain, comes into the ſoul in an heart humbling and breaking way; And ſometimes it blows away rain, and comes into the ſoul in a cheering, and heart comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting way.</p>
                     <p>In both theſe the ſoul hath communion with God, in joys, and tears, in mournings, as well as comfortings.</p>
                     <p>And that in the general to anſwer the miſtake of weaker Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>And now to the anſwer of the queſtion, How a man ſhall know when he hath had communion with God in a duty?</hi>

                     <p n="1">1 <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> 1 In general, then thou meeteſt with God, and haſt communion with God in duty, when God hath inabled thee to act grace in a duty.</p>
                     <p>An unregenerate man may act parts, and gifts in a duty, but he cannot act grace, hee hath none to act.</p>
                     <p>If then God do inable thee to act grace in a duty, to act thy faith to cloſe with promiſes, to act thy repentance for ſinne, to act
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:97371:185"/> love to God; All or any of theſe graces, thy ſoul hath then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in duty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Again, When the performance of a duty doth lead the ſoul in better frame, a more humble frame, or in a more watchful frame, when the heart is more quickned, or more broken.</p>
                     <p>When the heart is farther ſet againſt ſin; more reſolved to walk with God, and obey him, when the frame of a mans ſpirit is changed, or bettered in any of theſe ways, it is a ſign that thou haſt had communion with God in duty, though God hath not come in with fulneſs of comfort, with chearings or joys.</p>
                     <p>In this life, moſt of our communion lyes in quickning grace.</p>
                     <p>In the life to come, our communion is riſen up to full comfort, our life then is all joy.</p>

I ſay where there is ſincerity, there is a deſire of more, all is but a little of that abundance that is in his heart. When hee hath mourned for ſinne, hee wiſheth ſtill he could mourn more. Hee hath an affection of ſorrow within him, larger than any expreſsion of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hee can ſhew. So you ſee <hi>David, Rivers of tears runne down mine eyes becauſe men keep not thy law.</hi> Not that <hi>David</hi> had ſo much moiſture within him as to ſwell a river, poor man! hee had not ſo much moiſture in him; but he had ſuch an affection of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that if hee had had as many tears as would have ſwelled a River, made a Sea, they ſhould all have been laid out for ſin.</p>
                     <p>And indeed if a man had wept a ſea of tears, and his affections of mourning, did end with his expreſsions of ſorrow, hee had not yet wept at all, nor ſhed one true tear of godly ſorrow for ſin.</p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:97371:186"/>
                     <p>So again, when hee hath prayed, ſtill his heart is above his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hee riſeth up praying from prayer, with a praying ſpirit, affections, when the Prayer is done.</p>
                     <p>This was that which made Chriſt commend the poor Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows charity; ſhee gave but two mites, and yet hee ſaith, ſhee had given more than all the reſt. Her heart was bigger than her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, her affections, than her expreſſions of charity. Others they gave, but their purſes were larger than their hearts, they emptied their hearts, but not their purſes. Shee, her heart was bigger than her purſe, ſhee emptied her purſe, but not her heart, thus ſhee gave more.</p>
                     <p>So this is the fourth; a ſincere heart is larger than his duty, hee riſeth up praying from Prayer, all hee doth is but a little of that hee deſires to do, but a little of that abundance that is in his heart. Others, their actions are as large, nay larger than their hearts, they have little heart to the duty, and their heart is gone, hath done, before the duty bee done. A wicked man doth ſin out of the abundance of his heart; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>out of the abundance of the heart, come, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 12.34. Hee is never weary of ſinning, hee hath a fountain for that; but though hee ſin out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his heart, yet hee doth not pray out of the abundance of his heart; his heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s done, before his Prayer is done, if not, they end together. Well, think of it, hee who yet hath not this Principle which I ſpeak of, hath not yet a Goſpel Principle, though hee do neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſo much, hee is not yet under the conditions of Grace and Mercy. Theſe are the loweſt terms of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

                        <hi>A heart ſincere in Prayer doth eye it ſelf in Prayer; it is a heart that diligently obſerves it ſelf in the duty; views all the workings of the ſoul, and takes notice of all the imperfections of the ſpirit in duty. As to gather comfort, and praiſe God if right, ſo to bee humbled and afflicted, if amiſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed our ſincerity is as much diſcovered in lamenting the imperfections of a work, as in the moſt perfect performance of it. Where then the heart is ſincere, the ſoul takes notice of the imperfections that do accompany it, and when the duty is done, falls a lamenting the imperfections of its Faith, of its ſorrows, the deadneſs of its deſires. Ah! it now laments that hee hath beheld ſo much ſin with no more ſorrow, looked upon ſo many abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with no more mourning. That hee hath had no more Faith to cloſe with the Promiſes of pardon, of Grace, of purging. That hee hath had ſo barren, ſo ſhallow, ſo ſleight thoughts of Gods love. That hee hath been ſo cold in his affections again towards God. That he hath had ſo ſleight conceptions of ſin, and no more ſorrow for it. That his heart hath been no more affected with the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97371:186"/> miſeries of others, nor no more inlarged to ſeek God for them. That there hath been ſo much earth in Heaven, ſo many carnal thoughts, ſo much diſtractions in his ſpiritual imploiment. Ah! my Brethren, a good heart ſits down when duty is done, and goes and mourns over all his Prayers, weeps over all his tears, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all his confeſſions, and prayes over all his Prayers. And hee makes up the want of a duty with ſighs, the imperfection of a duty with tears.</p>
                     <p>Aſſure you ſelves, God is as much honoured in your mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for imperfections of a duty, as hee is by your moſt perfect performance of it. Bluſhing in Gods account is perfect beauty. When a ſoul can bluſh and bee aſhamed for the blemiſhes which are in its ſpiritual beauty; God looks upon this ſoul as beautiful. This is all wee can do, to deſire and mourn, to aime at the higheſt in our deſires, and to mourn when wee fall ſhort of what wee deſire. A Chriſtian is made up of theſe two things, deſires, and mournings. Deſires, Oh that my heart were directed! Oh that I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve more, love more, prize more! Oh that I were more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods Nature and Will, &amp;c. and then comes in mournings, <hi>O miſerable man that I am! &amp;c.</hi> Oh that my heart ſhould bee ſo hard, my ſpirit ſo dead, my ſoul ſo cold in holy exerciſes!

                     <p>Well then, let us make up the want of our beauty with a bluſh, the imperfections of our duties with ſighs and tears, and then caſt them all into the arms of Chriſt for acceptance.</p>
                     <p>If you convey a duty to him with tears, hee will preſent it to his Father with blood, hee will ſprinkle it with his own blood, mingle it with his own merits, perfume it with his own odors, as you read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.4.

                        <hi>A ſincere mourning, is a deep mourning; a ſad and ſerious ſorrow for ſin.</hi> Such a ſorrow as doth deeply affect the heart, with the thoughts and apprehenſions of the burthen and bitterneſs of ſin.</p>
                     <p>A ſincere mourner hath ſad and deep apprehenſions of the nature, demerit and filthineſs of ſin; he looks upon ſin as an offence againſt a juſt, a pure, a holy God; as the breach of a pure, a holy, and an eternal Law; as a wounding and crucifying of Chriſt; as a grieving and ſadding of the ſpirit of Grace, as a wounding and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing his own ſoul for ever. Which deep and inward thoughts of the nature of ſin; work deep, and inward mourning for ſin. The heart is wounded, the ſoul humbled and grieved, his ſpirit melted and peirced within him for ſin, which hee hath committed againſt God. It is not his tongue only that repents in expreſſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, his eyes in weeping, but his heart in deep and inward mournings for ſin. Another may make more noiſe, more cryings, roarings, howlings; but his ſorrow is more inward, more ſecret, more ſtill, and yet more deep. As you know the deepeſt waters run the ſtilleſt, ſo the deepeſt ſorrow makes leaſt noiſe. So that is the firſt, <hi>a ſincere mourning, is a deep mourning.</hi> An Hypocrite, his mournings are but ſhallow mournings, hee hath but ſhallow and fleeting thoughts of the nature and demerit of ſin; hee may ſay with <hi>Pharaoh, I have ſinned,</hi> or cry out in a ſtrait, <hi>Lord have mercy upon mee,</hi> or hang down his head like a bulruſh for a day, or roar upon the preſent rack of trouble for a time, but he never hath any deep and ſerious thoughts of ſin, as ſin. His prayers are how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and his mournings are roarings.

                     <p>As hee hates all, ſmall and great, ſo <hi>hee mourns for all,</hi> yea for ſuch ſins is his heart affected, which another mans light doth not diſcover to bee ſins.<note place="margin">Peccata va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam.</note> An unſound heart may mourn for ſome greater ſins, ſuch as have made great wounds and gaſhes in his conſcience: but for ſins, <hi>quotidiana incurſionis,</hi> for
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:97371:190"/> omiſſions and common frailties, wandring of thoughts, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in duty, deadneſs, coldneſs, unbeleef, theſe gnats can hee ſwallow, his light doth not diſcover theſe to bee ſins.</p>
                     <p>Nay, yet further, A ſincere mourning is not only an univerſal mourning, that hee mourns for all ſinnes of his own, but hee mourns for other mens ſinnes as well as his own, he hath a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain within him, which runnes over to the good of others. Wee have read of ſome who have mourned for their own ſinnes, and yet have been unſound. You ſee <hi>Pharaoh, Ahab, Judas.</hi> But wee never read of any who were grieved with, and have mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the ſinnes of others as well as his own, but their hearts were ſound. <hi>Lot</hi> his righteous ſoul was grieved for the ſinnes of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and yee know his heart was ſound, hees called <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lot. David</hi> hee mourned for the ſinnes of others, yea ſuch as were his enemies,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.139</note> as hee ſaith, <hi>Rivers of tears runne down mine eyes, becauſe mine enemies keep not thy Law:</hi> And you know <hi>David</hi> was ſincere, God tells us hee was a man after his own heart, and the heart of <hi>David</hi> was ſingle and ſincere with God. The like I might tell you of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Samuel,</hi> of <hi>Daniel, Nehemiah,</hi> and others; hee that mourns only in relation to guilt and hell, that mans Ciſtern runnes out only for his own houſe. Hee mourns for ſinne no farther than it doth reflect upon himſelf, and ſo not for ſin as ſin, but ſin as it is evil to him, as it binds him over to the wrath of God, and eternal damnation.</p>
                     <p>But hee that mourns for ſinne, in its own nature, as an offence to an holy, pure, gracious God, his fountain runs over to the uſe of others, hee goes and mourns over other mens ſins as well as his own. Wee read the Angels, <hi>they rejoyce at the converſion of a ſinner.</hi> What is the ground? do they receive any further addition of good thereby? no they are full, but therefore do they rejoyce, becauſe God is further glorified. And if joys were capable of ſorrows, heaven of tears, they would upon the ſame ground mourn for the ſinnes of mee, becauſe thereby God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured. And if wee could ſee God as they do, our hearts <hi>would bee filled with grief, our eyes with tears,</hi> to ſee, the God ſo great, ſo gracious, ſo holy; to bee abuſed and wronged by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, though wee no way guilty of their ſinne. Thus <hi>a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart hee mourns for other mens ſinnes as well as his own,</hi> he is grieved when his enemys do break Gods laws, not ſo much becauſe they hurt or wound him, but becauſe they diſhonour God and wound their own ſouls. It troubles him to ſee men ſwear and lye, to joyn hearts &amp; hands together againſt God, his cauſe, his Church, his people, his Miniſters, not becauſe they hurt him, but ſtrike againſt God, and ſo but beat themſelves againſt a rock, and break themſelves, do that which will turn to their own ſhame, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at the laſt, which is the beſt end that can bee expected of ſin.</p>

Thats the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The ſecond Proportion is, <hi>To the merit of Sin.</hi> Sincere mourning is proportionable to the merit of ſinne;<note place="margin">Non actu ſed affectu.</note> as the demerit of ſin is infinite, ſo ſorrow for it muſt bee an infinite ſorrow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite I ſay, not in the act and expreſſion, yet in the affection of the ſoul. As it is ſaid of a wicked man, <hi>if hee ſhould live for ever hee would ſinne for ever,</hi> in reſpect of his deſire and will to ſinne, and therefore becauſe hee ſins <hi>in aeterno ſui,</hi> hee is puniſhed <hi>in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno Dei.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So I may ſay of a godly man, if hee ſhould live for ever, hee would ſorrow for ever. His ſorrow is infinite in deſire and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, though finite in the act and expreſſion of it. And indeed a bounded, a ſtinted ſorrow is no ſorrow. Hee whoſe heart and eyes do dry up together, whoſe expreſſion in tears and affections of ſorrow do end together, though hee had wept a ſea of tears, hee hath not yet mourned for ſin. As I told you laſt day, that <hi>a Sincere heart doth riſe up praying from Prayer,</hi> ſo hee goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way weeping from weeping, with a weeping heart when his eyes are dry. Godly ſorrow hath affections of mourning, when the expreſſions of mourning ceaſeth, becauſe every drop of tears doth ariſe from a ſea of tears within. As every act of faith doth ariſe from a beleeving diſpoſition, a habit of faith within: ſo every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſorrow from an affection of ſorrow in the ſpirit; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drop of tears from a ſpring and fountain of tears within the ſoul. Hence wee read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> cap. 7. verſ. 6. where their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is expreſſed by this phraſe, <hi>They drew water as out of a well, as out of a ſpring, and poured out before the Lord,</hi> Their eyes did not empty ſo faſt as their heart filled. Their eyes could not poure it forth ſo faſt, as their hearts did yeild it up. All their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of mourning were leſs, than their affections of mourning. And ſhall I now tell you, though your ſorrow may bee ſincere, and yet not proportionable to the meaſure of ſin, yet your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cannot bee ſincere, if not proportionable to the merit of Sin; if it be not infinite ſorrow, infinite I ſay, in the deſire and affection, though not in the act and expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>And alas how few there are Sincere mourners! you that are ſturdy Sinners, you dry eyed Sinners, you hard hearted Sinners, when was the time you have thus mourned for ſin, wee ſee your ſinnings every day, but who hears of your repentings? wee hear of your drunkenneſſe, your ſwearing, your lying, your gaming, your dicing, and revelling, even till the morning watch upon

As it was ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> that hee added this to all his wickedneſs, that hee ſhut up <hi>John</hi> in Priſon; this was the great aggravation of his ſin, this fill'd his meaſure, hee added this to all. So there are ſome who will adde this to all their ſins, that adde this to all their drunkenneſs, their ſwearing, gaming, revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to perſecute and evilly intreat thoſe who are Gods meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to them.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Of the freeneſs and willingneſs of God to pardon ſin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And then throws it ſelf upon the Mercy of God; the grace of Chriſt, for pardon and forgiveneſs. Which though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to bee ſmall, yet it will coſt you ſomething before ever you reach this.</p>
                     <p>But now the mourning of an Hypocrite doth not ariſe from
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:97371:192"/> Faith, but from ſenſe, either from ſome preſent ſting, or trouble of conſcience, or from ſome outward preſſures upon the body. And hence it comes to paſs that his ſorrow is not a conſtant ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, while the trouble laſts, the weight is upon him, ſo long hee howles and cryes; but if once the trouble bee blown over, the Sky clears, his mourning is done. As <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of his praying, will hee pray alwayes? hee will not. So I may ſay of his mourning, will hee mourn alwayes? hee will not. When conſcience wrings him, when the heart is overwhelmed with trouble, then hee falls a howling, and crying, but when the trouble is over, hee wipes his eyes, and mourns no more. But now again, hee, whoſe ſorrow doth ariſe from Faith, hee doth not only mourn when conſcience is troubled, but when conſcience is at peace. Nay, when the heart is fulleſt of peace and joy, the eyes are biggeſt with tears; when the pearle of joy is in the heart, the dew of tears is in the eyes. I ſay, when the ſoul hath moſt aſſurance of Gods love, then will Faith produce child-like arguments to raiſe up the ſprings of ſorrows in us, to open all the fountains of tears in the ſoul. Oh will the ſoul ſay! hath God been ſo mercifull? and am I ſo ſinfull? Hath hee been ſo good to mee? and I ſo evil to him? As the frowns of God do break the heart, ſo the ſmiles of God do melt and diſſolve it.</p>

                     <p>There are the mournings of a ſon, and the mournings of a ſlave; the one doth ariſe from fear, the other from love; love 1. Of God to the ſoul. 2. Of the ſoul to God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the conſideration of Gods love to the ſoul. When the ſoul ſits down, and recounts the immenſity, greatneſs of Gods love to it; when it takes a view of what God might have done with it, and what God hath done with it; how juſtly hee might have damned the ſoul, and how mercifully hee hath ſaved the ſoul; what coſt, what care, what pains, what ſweat, what blood hee hath laid out to ſave us, and how eaſily hee might have damned us; Oh! this melts and diſſolves the ſoul; the ſoul even crumbles into duſt, and diſſolves into water, under the thoughts of it.

Oh theſe thoughts do lay a man in the duſt. God hath taken ſuch a way to juſtifie and ſave men, that if wee bee but men, it will break our hearts that wee have offended him. Who is it that can read over that place without tears? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.24, 25. Thou haſt bought mee no ſweet Cane with money, neither haſt thou filled
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:97371:192"/> mee with the fat of thy ſacrifices, but thou haſt wearied mee with thine iniquities; and haſt made mee ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt made my mercy to ſerve, my patience to ſerve, with thy ſinnes, even to look on while thou abuſedſt mee. And what would a man imagine now would follow after this, Therefore I will plague thee, I will puniſh thee. But read and wonder, and read; withhold from tears if thou canſt, if any ſpark of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bee in thee, <hi>I, even I, am he who blotteth out thine iniquities for my own names ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> Here was the wonder of mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It ariſeth from the love of thy ſoul to God. The love of the perſon offended doth cauſe a godly man to mourn, that hee hath offended him. You ſee <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee, have I ſinned;</hi> godly ſorrow, ſincere mourning is an ingenuous mourning, ſcarce a thought of Hell and damnation comes into the mind, if they do; alas! theſe do not trouble him ſo much as his ſin; that hee hath grieved and offended ſo good a God by Sin. Hence <hi>Zachary</hi> hath this expreſſion.<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10</note> 
                        <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn, &amp;c.</hi> In which there is nothing but pure love; the expreſſion is obſervable, the Prophet doth not ſay, they ſhall mourn as a ſon for a Father, there may bee ſelf-love in that, a child may ſee himſelf undone in the loſs of a father; but hee ſaith, <hi>they ſhall mourn as a father for a ſon, in which there is pure love.</hi> But now with Hypocrites, it is neither the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods love to them, nor any love or good will which they bear to God, that makes them mourn, but indeed love to themſelves, they have Sinned and are afraid God will damn them for Sin, therefore it is terror, no principle of love to God, which draws them to mourn for Sin. As they hate Sin only in reference to hell, ſo they mourn for Sin only in reference to hell.</p>
                     <p>What St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of fear of ſin, I may ſay of ſorrow for Sin. <hi>Hee that fears ſin for Hell, fears not to Sinne, but to burn, but hee hates ſinne indeed, who ſo hates ſin as hell it ſelf.</hi>

                     <p>There are paenal tears, and fruitful tears, Worldly ſorrow that is paenal ſorrow, it is a weeping to weeping, but godly ſorrow is a fruitful ſorrow, a weeping to repentance, and amendment, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Godly ſorrow, works repentance, not to bee repented of,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10. There is a great deal of difference between the pains of the gout, and of a woman in travel, the one is pain to pain, no fruit of the pain, meer torture, the other is pain to eaſe, travel to reſt, a travel to birth. Other ſorrow is a ſorrow to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:97371:193"/> this is a ſorrow to joy, as Chriſt expreſſeth it under the parable of a woman in travell. Sincere mourning is a fruitfull mourning, for repentance is like the waters of jealouſy, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rot or make fruitful.</p>
                     <p>And firſt <hi>It is a heart humbling ſorrow.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>It is a grace ſtrengthning, a grace increaſing ſorrow.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth God preſerve ſuch ſprings as theſe in the hearts of his people, on purpoſe to water the ſeed of holineſſe, the garden of graces in the hearts of his people. Every grace within us doth look freſh, every diſpoſition within us buds, ſhoots forth after a ſhowre of repentant tears, that man who hath ſuch ſprings as theſe within him, his graces muſt needs flouriſh, they cannot wither nor decay.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve it, A mourning Chriſtian is evermore a thriving, a growing Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>It is a divorcing ſorrow,</hi> it breaks the league and union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween heart and Sin. There is a league between the heart and ſin, they are as neer together as the skin to the fleſh, as the fleſh to the bones, the bark to the tree: Godly ſorrow doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce between a mans heart and ſinne; ſeparates between them, it ſets the ſoul at a diſtance with ſin; Unſound hearts may mourn, may lament ſin, but leave not Sin, they Sin and Repent, and Repent and Sin; as if their Sinning did but make matter for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This is like the Drunken mans round, his drink goes out in tears, and then to drink again. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could ſay hee had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but hee left not his Sinne, <hi>Saul</hi> could ſay hee had Sinned too, yet hee retained his ſinne, <hi>Judas</hi> ſaid the like, yet if he had lived, he had been the ſame, if God had not changed his heart. No, if a man ſhould have lain as long in flames as <hi>Cain</hi> hath, and ſhould come out of hell, red hot out of flames, hee would bee the ſame man ſtill. All the terrors of God, all the horrors in the World, all the flames of hell cannot change the heart. Theſe may dare a man, make a man afraid to ſin, but not hate Sin, this muſt come from a principle of Grace, a Goſpel work. The juſtice of God may terrify the heart, the power of God may awe the heart, but it muſt be the love and mercy of God, which muſt thaw the heart, muſt change the heart. Now godly ſorrow doth work a change in the ſoul;<note place="margin">Job 34.32</note> ſuch a man ſaith with <hi>Job; If I have done iniquity I will do it no more,</hi> hee lamenteth ſin and leaveth Sin, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and forſaketh Sin, God forgives, and he alſo foregoes ſin.</p>
                     <p>Beſide theſe fruits I might name many more, which are the fruits of ſincere mourning. It worketh peace, our tears end in joy, it worketh ſpiritual tranquillity of Conſcience, as it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a change.</p>
                     <p>And beſides theſe you have ſeven ſpecial and particular fruits,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:97371:193"/> ſet down (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.) of godly ſorrow, on which I want time to inſiſt. But now an hypocrites ſorrow is a ſorrow to ſorrow, a paenal not a fruitful ſorrow, hee is never the better for all his howling, his heart never the more humble, his ſpirit never the more broken, his ſoul never the more ſet againſt Sin. Theſe tears they leave him as they found him, they are not changing and transforming tears, hee is never the more watchful, never the more careful to pleaſe God, hee rather grows more ſecure, takes more heart to ſin againſt God, hee thinks hee hath done penance and ſatisfied the Law, hee hath diſcharged the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſcore by his preſent roarings, and therefore may beginne a new reckoning, a new ſcore, and ſin more freely againſt God: whereas true mourning makes us watchfull, and ſo our falls make us ſecure.</p>
                     <p>To ſum up all in a little.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The unſound heart, hee mourns for Sin either as clad with puniſhment, or as it bringeth the evil of puniſhment after it, the firſt you ſee in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the ſecond in <hi>Ahab.</hi> The other laments Sin as Sin, ſin abſtracted and ſeparated from wrath and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The one howls under the preſent laſhes, the evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other under the evil of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Sence doth provoke the one to mourning, faith and love do cauſe the other to mourn.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The ground of the one is ſelf-love, the ground of the other, love to God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The one is ſlaviſh, the other childiſh.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 The end of the one is peace and joy, of the other, it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and diſpair, as in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Hee is ſuch a one as makes conſcience of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Command, great or ſmal. Every one comes from the ſame authority, <hi>James</hi> 2.11.

An unſound ſpirit looks no further than the bare letter of the Command, that part which bindes the fleſh or outward man only, and if hee do but obſerve that in the groſs, hee thinks hee hath done well; but now a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart, hee looks to the ſpirit of the Command, and if hee do not obſerve that, hee hath no peace; if you keep the whole Law in the letter, and give way to your ſelves to fail in any, and do not ſincerely indeavour to obey all according to the ſpirit, your ſpirits are unſound. Hee that will ſee God with comfort, muſt not only obey the letter of the Command, but muſt bring his heart to the ſincere Obedience of the ſpirit of the Command.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Hee will not only obey God only in the Matter, but in the Manner, not only in the ſubſtance, but in the circumſtance of the Command.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee is not only conſcionable to obey God in what hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but his heart is wrought to a conſcionableneſs in the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. An unſound heart looks no further than the ſubſtance of the Command, if hee have but prayed, if been at Church, hee thinks all is well, hee looks no further. But now a ſound ſpirit, hee looks to the circumſtance, as well as the ſubſtance, the manner, as well as the matter of the command. When hee prayes, hee labours to pray fervently, faithfully. When hee hears, hee will hear humbly, fruitfully, when hee obeyes, hee deſires to obey willingly, chearfully, &amp;c. Wee ſay, <hi>bonum eſt ex integrâ cauſâ,</hi> but <hi>malum ex quolibet defectu;</hi> Take any action, if either the Principle whence it doth ariſe bee not good, that the action ariſe from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Principles, ſelf-love, carnal fears; or if the purpoſes bee not good, that the aims and ends bee carnal, or if the circumſtances bee not good, it ſpoils the action. If wee pray, and pray not fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, if wee heat, and hear not fruitfully, if wee obey, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not willingly, if wee ſhew mercy, and do it not chearfully, if
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:97371:195"/> you ſanctifie the Sabbath, and not with delight, all is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome circumſtances acceſſory, ſome neceſſary; ſome wherein the being, and ſome wherein but the well-being of a duty doth conſiſt. And if you abſtract theſe from them, the duty it is worth nothing. Take away fervency, and humility from Prayer, take away faithfulneſs and fruitfulneſs from hearing, take away willingneſs and delight from Obedience, all is nothing worth. So much for the firſt Character of ſincere Obedience. Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

                        <hi>a ſound Obedience ariſeth from ſound Principles.</hi> A ſoul renewed, a ſoul univerſally ſanctified, and principled from above. Such as the Principle is, ſuch is a mans Obedience, dead Principles, and but dead Obedience, unſound Principles, and unſound Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. A mans actions can go no higher than his Principles. There muſt bee a good tree, before good fruit, the perſon muſt bee good, before the actions can bee good; if there bee a crack in the perſon, all is naught. Now this ſincere Principle which is the ſpirit of all our Obedience; it is nothing elſe but an entire and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual frame of Grace and Holineſs ſet up in the ſoul, whereby a man is renewed and changed. Which is called in Scripture, <hi>a new Creation, a writing of the Law in the heart, Regeneration, Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reſurrection from death to life,</hi> and a <hi>forming Chriſt in the ſoul.</hi> As it hath a reſpect to the heart, the ſeat of theſe Principles, it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows five names.</p>
                     <p>It is called 1. A ſound heart, in oppoſition to an unſound, a falſe ſpirit. 2. A perfect heart, in oppoſition to an Hypocritical ſpirit. 3. And a ſingle heart, in oppoſition to a doubleneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. 4. An honeſt heart, in oppoſition to a deceitful heart. 5. A whole heart, in oppoſition to a half, a divided ſpirit which God hates. And where Obedience is ſincere, it ariſeth from ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. A ſound, perfect, &amp;c. ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>As it comes from a right riſe, ſo hee walks by a right Rule in his Obedience,</hi> and that's the whole will of God revealed in his Word; if God ſaith, do, hee doth; if God ſaith, do not, hee will not do. If hee have no command from Heaven, hee ſtands ſtill like a ſhip becalmed, and wanting a wind, hee will not ſtir.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe things which are motives to others move not him. But when a command comes, his ſails are filled, he is carried on with ſtrength in obedience to it. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. Wee have the ſame
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:97371:196"/> metaphor; Bee filled with all the will of the Lord, let the will of God, his command, bee the only motive, that carries you on in the ſervice of God. Thus you ſee it was with <hi>David,</hi> he had reſpect to the Commandements, he had not reſpect to the world, to men, to his own ends, advantages, which are the ſpring of others obedience, but hee hath reſpect to the Command, he eyes that, hee will obey if there be a Command.</p>
                     <p>A Sincere heart doth not only do things good in themſelves, and ſuch as God hath commanded, but hee doth them becauſe God hath Commanded them; Gods preceps are the ground of his practiſe, Pſal. 119.4, 5. <hi>Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy Precepts. Oh that my ways were directed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 He obeys after a right manner, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 He levels his actions to right ends.</p>
                     <p>As nothing below God is the ſpring of his obedience, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below God is the end of his obedience. Gods grace is the ſpring, Gods glory is the end of all his obedience. An unſound heart hath baſe and unſound ends, credit, repute, profit, eſteem or the like. Hee now makes not the world his end, no not the world to come; the ſalvation of his ſoul, the end of all his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Indeed this is a ſecondary, a ſubſervient, a ſubordinate end, but not the ultimate end, the primary, the univerſal end; Gods glory is the Sea, to which all his actions like ſo many rivers move and bend. It is true I grant, that other ends may creep into the performance of good actions, and that not only lower, but baſer ends than this.</p>
                     <p>But wee are to diſtinguiſh between a mans ſetled, and his ſuggeſted end, a mans ſetled end may bee one thing, yet his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted end bee contrary, God reckons according to the ſetled end, the univerſal purpoſe and frame of his ſpirit, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuggeſted ends. It is in this caſe as it may bee with a man that ſhoots at a mark, hee aims aright at the mark, but there may come a jog upon the elbow, which may carry the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row another way, than hee intended. Or as it is with a man that ſets out to go to ſuch a haven, he ſets out aright, and ſteers aright by his compaſſe, but the winds blow contrary and carry him whether hee would not. But then as the Apoſtle, <hi>If I do the thing I would not, it is no more I, but ſinne.</hi> It was <hi>Bernards</hi> caſe, hee had ſet upon a good work, and levels his action to the glory of God, that was his aim, his end, but there were other ends ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, pride, oſtentation, vain-glory, which hee obſerving, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters them in this manner,<note place="margin">Abi hinc, nec propter te in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepi, nec prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter te deſinam.</note> 
                        <hi>Abi hinc, &amp;c.</hi> get hence, avoid, you were not the ground of my beginning this work, nor will I for you conclude this work. And it would bee our wiſdome, when a man hath ſet his heart aright in the beginning, when hee hath ſet out aright, if any other ends bee ſuggeſted, to reject them in the like manner, being neither the ſpring of the action, nor the end of the action.</p>

                     <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay further, Is it requiſite for the clearing of the ſincerity of our hearts, that wee have a continuall eye to the glory of God in every action wee do? Is there required ſuch an actual intention of the ſpirit in every particular action, &amp;c. that he ſhould aim at Gods glory?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the Anſwer of this, I muſt lay down this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>An habitual aime and intention.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>An actual intention of the ſpirit in every particular action that a man doth to the glory of God.</hi> It is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the ſtate and condition of this life, it is poſſible for Angels and glorified Saints to do it, for they are in Gods viſion, and it is all their work in heaven, but it is impoſſible for us to do it here below, no it was not poſsible for <hi>Adam</hi> in his inno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ency to do it.</p>
                     <p>But now ſecondly, <hi>There is an habitual inclination in us in every action we do,</hi> to aim at Gods glory, though there be not the actual intention of the ſpirit in every action we do. It is with us as with a man travelling towards a town, hee thinks in the morning to go to ſuch a town; ſuch a place hee aims to bee at, at night; and therefore ſets out towards it; and though hee doth not think of this every ſtep hee takes, yet its his purpoſe in his journey to reſt there at night. Or as it is with a man who comes to Church, his end is to hear the word of God, yet in every word he hears ſpoken, he hath not the thought of his end upon his ſpirit, but he is there by vertue of his firſt intention. So here though in every particular, there bee not an intention of ſpirit to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel this or that to this end; yet it is the drift and habitual ſcope of the ſpirit, that Gods glory may bee the end of his actions.</p>
                     <p>Nay, Thirdly, Though wee are not able to do it in the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intention, yet it muſt bee our care to renew our habitual inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as farre as wee can, to draw up theſe habitual purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, into actual levellings of theſe and theſe particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the glory of God. There are ſome go further in this than others.</p>
                     <p>Aſſure your ſelves, the nearer you come to an actual intention of ſpirit for Gods glory in particular acts, the nearer you are the life of heaven. How ever let us ſo renew our firſt thoughts, habitual intentions, as that wee may thereby keep in the right path, the right way, till wee come to our journies end at night. So much intention a Travailer holds up as to keep him in the right way, to keep him from going into by paths, although not ſo much as ſhall make him in every ſtep hee takes to think of his firſt intention, the end of his journey. So much for the ſecond Character.</p>

                     <p>It is a growing obedience, hee contents not himſelf with the meaſures hee hath, but labours after perfection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. verſ. 12. to the 15. <hi>I have not yet attained, nor am already perfect, &amp;c.</hi> A ſincere heart hee aims at the top of all, hee looks at the work it ſelf, hee propounds not to himſelf a ſhorter end than God would have him reach unto, Gods end is his, and that's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; hee deſires conformity to the pattern in the mount, to bee holy as God is holy, perfect as &amp;c. An unſound heart hee bounds and ſtints himſelf, at theſe and theſe meaſures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to go no further; fulneſſe of holineſſe and perfection of grace, is not his aim nor deſire. Hee may deſire ſo much, as may ſerve his own turns, and ends, no more; ſo much as may ſerve his own advantages, hee deſires; but cares for no more than hee can make uſe of in the way. As the Phyſician who doth not deſire excellency in the Science, yet he will take in ſo much skill, as may ſerve his turn and practice; but hee cares not for more. The like I might ſay of any other Artiſt, whoſe ſpirit is not taken with the beauty of the things themſelves, yet he deſires ſo much as may ſerve ends.</p>
                     <p>Even ſo an unſound ſpirit; whoſe heart is nothing taken with the beauties of holineſſe, yet hee may deſire ſo much as may ſerve his turns, his ſecular advantages, but hee will have no more. A Tradeſ-man will take in ſomewhat, it may bee hee will not ſwear bloody oathes in the face of his cuſtomers, this were to drive men away, this could not ſtand with his ends; if hee were ſuch a one, men would avoid him; and therefore hee will take in ſo much as will ſerve his trade, and no more: theſe men deſire the Talent, not for the maſters uſe, but for their own uſe. So in any other. But now it is otherwiſe with a ſincere heart, his deſire is to abound in holineſs, he ſees ſo much beauty in God, that he cannot be at reſt till hee bee ſwallowed up with God, made all like him, hee ſees ſo much excellency in Grace, that nothing but perfection will ſatisfy him. Nay, and he doth not only make perfection his utmoſt end, but hee labours after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with his utmoſt ſtrength and endeavours. And the ground of all this, is, becauſe a ſincere heart looks ſingly to God, and therefore ſerves him with all his might; while a mans heart is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, his ſtrength is alſo divided. That mans ſtrength is not whole for God whoſe heart is not ſo, But when God is made the one of a mans deſires, the one of a mans affections, the one of a mans life and comfort, then will hee bee the one of a mans endeavours too, and a man deſires to ſerve God with all his might. Such men, again, give up themſelves to the ſervice of God. Lord I am thine, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> and therefore will do his work with all
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:97371:197"/> their ſtrength. As there are none more ſtrong in the Devils work, than ſuch as have ſold themſelves to it; as it was ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi> hee ſold himſelf, hee gave over his whole heart to ſin: ſo there is none more induſtrious in Gods work, than ſuch as give themſelves up to God, ſuch as paſs over themſelves by deed of gift to him. When a man can once ſay truly with them in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.5. One ſhall ſay, <hi>I am the Lords, &amp;c.</hi> Then is his whole might laid out in the ſervice of God. Thus a ſincere Obedience is a fruitful Obedience, an abounding Obedience, as God doth not ſtint his mercy to him, ſo hee doth not his ſervice to God. If indeed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had been bounded to us, wee had been undone, if hee had ſaid, I will pardon ſome ſins, but not all, or if hee had ſaid, I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all, I will juſtifie, but not ſanctifie; or if hee had ſaid, I will do this, &amp;c. but not, &amp;c.

                     <p>It is ſet down as the Character in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.

They are willing to ſuffer too, to go through good reports, and bad reports, through a Sea, and through a Wilderneſs, through the hotteſt ſervices, and ſtrongeſt oppoſitions for Chriſt; it is a chearful Obedience, hee delights in the Law of God. As it was ſaid of Chriſt, ſo it may bee ſaid of him in ſome meaſure. <hi>It was meat and drink to him to do his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will;</hi> duties they are medicines to unſound ſpirits, but meat to him. Hence <hi>David</hi> ſets down this for a Character of a godly man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>His delight is in the Law of God,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, that <hi>his delight was in the Law of God, as concerning the inner man.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> hath it up and down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Lord, how I love thy Law!</hi> eccho like, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I delight to do thy will, thy Law is in my heart.</hi> There was a Principle within him agreeable to the Precept without him. As the eye delights in ſeeing, the ear in hearing, ſo the heart in obeying. Actions of nature, you know they are actions of delight. So of the new nature. But this muſt bee underſtood, when the Principle within, which ſhould yeeld Obedience, is not diſturbed, for as it is in nature, though it bee a natural act, and full of delight for the eye to ſee; yet if the eye bee offended or hurt, it will breed a tediouſneſs in the eye to do its natural act, and that in which formerly it did take ſo much delight. So here, though to obey and walk in Gods wayes, bee acts moſt ſutable to the new nature, yet if the ſpiritual Principles
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:97371:198"/> within bee wounded and hurt, it may breed ſome kinde of weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs and unwillingneſs in the ſoul to obey for the time, which may befal the deareſt of Gods Children in diverſe caſes, in theſe 7.</p>

I tell thee, if thou couldeſt heap up mountains of prayers, if weep a Sea of tears, if thou couldeſt macerate thy ſelf with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and humbling thy ſelf, as many thouſand years as the World hath ſtood minutes, from the Creation, yet without ſincerity, all this is nothing.

Why here was the ground and reaſon, there was a want of ſincerity, they had but ſerved themſelves in ſerving him, and therefore hee doth not own them.

                        <note place="margin">1 Hard to cure.</note> It is one of the hardeſt cures are wrought upon the ſouls of men. A cure ſeldome wrought. Wee have heard of a bloody and Idolatrous <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> an unclean <hi>Mary,</hi> an oppreſſing Publican, a perſecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> and many other fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and great, open, and notorious ſinners wrought upon, brought to life. But where have we read of the return of a <hi>Judas,</hi> of a <hi>Simon Magus?</hi> where do wee read of one example of ſuch as have been groſſe hypocrites, who have afterward been ſavingly wrought upon?</p>
                     <p>I confeſſe it is all one with God, to do the one, as the other, it is as eaſy with him to change the heart of an hypocrite, as any other, for infinite power and grace knows no difference, but it is a thing not ſo uſually done; And though as eaſy in reſpect of God, yet more difficult <hi>quoad nos.</hi> And ſo I would have you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand me, that the difficulty is in reſpect of us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It is hard to convince ſuch a man that hee needs a cure,<note place="margin">1 Hard to Convince.</note> you ſee it in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. verſ. 16, 17. God tells them they were luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, neither hot nor cold, there was their diſtemper; and yet you ſee what thoughts they had of themſelves, in the 17. verſ. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, thou art rich, and increaſed in goods, and haſt need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> So you ſee it is hard to convince ſuch a man. Another man is eaſily convinced, the very lives of them who are holy, are convictions to his Conſcience, and if the word be held out, he is ready to fall down, as not able to ſtand up under the light and evidence of it. In ſuch men wee have a friend within them, even their own natural conſciences are on our ſide, and ready to take part with us againſt themſelves, and fly in their own faces, telling them ſuch and ſuch things ought not to bee done. But now in the other, neither the examples of holy men, nor precepts of the word, do ſo farre convince them; for in outward appearance, they walk as blameleſly as the beſt. Nay and natural Conſcience is alſo for them, and being ſatisfied with ſome general performances of duty, is ready to take part with them, and to withſtand any conviction that can bee alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You ſee this in the Scribes and Phariſees, they walked
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:97371:200"/> blameleſly in the general to the eyes of the world, as you hearby his confeſſion in oppoſition to the Publican; and they faſted and prayed, and did much, and by that the mouth of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was ſtopped, the quarrels of conſcience were anſwered, and you finde how hard it was for Chriſt himſelf to convince them. They were ſo far from being convinced by his example, that they thought themſelves more ſtrict than hee; he did, but they would not accompany themſelves with ſinners, and therefore they gave ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that is the firſt, it is hard to convince them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Hard to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them.</note>2 It is hard to humble them. Humiliation follows conviction, if hard to convince, hard to humble. Do wee denounce threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt ſinners? alas! they are none of them, theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings do not concern them but others, for their parts they walk unblameably in the world. It is not the mercyes, nor the judgements, the promiſes, nor the threatnings, the word, nor the works of God which humble them. In others there may be ſome natural tenderneſs, ſome remorſe of ſpirit when they hear of Gods judgements againſt ſin. But for this man; <hi>it is not all the terrors of the Lord, not all the humbling breaking diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verys of ſin, or judgement which faſten upon him to humble him.</hi> No mans heart ſo hard as the Hypocrites, hee hath not only a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hardneſſe, but a contracted hardneſſe; nay a fortified and ſtrengthened hardneſſe, his heart is fortified againſt all reproof, againſt all the denunciations of wrath and judgement. You have a taſte of it in the Scribes and Phariſees. You know they were Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, hee who knew their hearts, better than they knew their own, tells them ſo. And it was not all the miracles hee did in his life, nor all the wonders which hee ſhewed at his death, which could break and humble their hard hearts; you ſee <hi>the Sun was darkned, the earth quakes and trembles, the vail of the Temple was rent, the graves open, the rocks cleave aſunder, yet all this doth not move their hard hearts.</hi>

That which moves others, moves not him, which works upon the hearts of others, doth leave his heart unwrought upon. He is a man, as I told you, prayer-proof, Sermon-proof,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:97371:200"/> and Ordinance-proof; no Mercy, no judgement, no promiſe, no threatning, no word, no works, no prayer, no Sacraments, no phyſick, no ſalve, no counſell, no advice, no light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no light of example, no private help, no publick exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation prevails with his heart; hee's a man in the fore-lorn hope; his condition neer deſperate. Cuſtome in the uſe of things, doth take away the power of working. You ſee in your bodies a little thing works upon the humors, when you are not uſed to it; whereas if accuſtomed to it, a much greater will not ſtir the humors.</p>
                     <p>I have read that <hi>Mithridates</hi> by accuſtoming himſelf to eat Poyſon, at laſt durſt venture upon poyſon as meat, nothing did hurt him. The cuſtomable uſe of things, takes away the power of working. So it is here, the cuſtome of Ordinances in a formal way, doth take away the power of working by them. You ſee it in the Sacrament; may bee, when you came firſt to the Sacrament, then Conſcience had ſome natural tenderneſſe in it, and you came trembling to this Ordinance, fearing leſt you ſhould prophane it, <hi>and by that eat and drink your own Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But now the cuſtome of prophanation, hath taken away the terror of prophaning this Ordinance; now you come and tremble not. So for the word, time was, when Conſcience was green and tender, that the word came with more majeſty, more authority on your ſpirits. Every command came with power, every threat came with trembling; but now you can ſit under the moſt powerful, quickening, convincing, awaking, diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, and your ſouls never moved. And hence is it, that your cuſtome with the Ordinances in a cuſtomary way, takes off the life, and power, and workings of Ordinances. As cuſtome in ſin doth harden the heart, and makes the heart more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to bee wrought upon: ſo cuſtome in duty if it bee done in a formal cuſtomable way. I would rather deal, and ſhould have more hopes of doing good to him who is openly prophane, noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wicked, than ſuch a man who lyes ſoaking under Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and goes on in a formal and cuſtomable performance of theſe dutys, without any ſpirit or life in the doing of them. Thus you ſee the firſt, 'tis a difficult cure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>It is a painful cure.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">It is a painful cure.</note> It will coſt thee much pain, many gripes and greifs, many Prayers and tears, much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and ſorrow before it can be wrought. Nay, tis a cure wrought by undoing all that thou haſt done, thou muſt unravel all, unpray thy prayers undo thy ſervices. Thou muſt not go forward in the way wherein thou art, but muſt come back all the way thou haſt gone, and go another way, if ever thou come to heaven. And this will coſt a man ſome pain. Suppoſe a man were going to ſome place, and had gone much of his journey, were now come, (as hee thought) near his journeys end, and one ſhould come to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:97371:201"/> him, and tell him; Sir you are clean out of the way, you muſt go back again, unride all this way you have come, &amp;c. O! how irkſome, how hardly would this down with a man at the end of his journey? eſpecially the way being pleaſant wherein hee was, and full of delight, but the other rough and foul in which hee was to go. Alas! would hee ſay, is there no way but turning back? is it not poſſible to ſtrike over? this is irkſome. Why ſo is it with a man here, it may be thou haſt ſet out for heaven, and thou haſt gone all thy life in a fair ſmooth way, and art now come, as thou thinkeſt; even to the end of thy journey. And will it not bee a hard thing for a man to turn back, to begin in another way, and that a ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a rougher, and a deeper way? Why I tell thee, this muſt bee done before ever thou come to heaven.</p>
                     <p>It is with a ſound Chriſtian and an Hypocrite, as it is with two men, at the top of two houſes in a narrow ſtreet, one would think that they could eaſily come to one another, eaſily reach, but the truth is, hee muſt come down the height where hee is, before hee can go up to him: A groſſe and open ſinner, is nearer to him, than a formal hypocrite. As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Eaſier for Publicans and Harlots, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now judge, is it not a very hard thing and difficult, for a man to undoe all hee hath done, to give up all for loſt, to come down from the height to which hee hath attained, not without much pains. To turn back that way, wherein hee hath rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with much difficulty. This is a hard thing, &amp;c. <hi>what fleſh and blood can bear this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So that it is not only a difficult, but a painful cure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 In reſpect of the medicines that are to bee applyed; hard phyſick, humbling, lancing, cutting, diſmembring, cutting off right hands, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>But this I cannot inſiſt upon. The truth is, the cure is ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that your ſpirits would rather continue the diſeaſe, than ſubmit to the plaiſter. But now though the cure be difficult, 'tis poſſible, 'tis eaſy with God, though hard to us. And if God have given thee a heart to deſire a cure, and a ſpirit wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſubmit to any means may bee uſed, it is a fair way towards the cure.

                     <p>This thought brought home, and ſuffered to lye upon thy ſpirit in ſerious conſideration, would e'ne half work the cure, it would cure all groſs Hypocriſy; ſtrike down all by-ends, and baſe ends, which thy ſpirit aims at in the doing of holy duties, and vvould do much in the cure of cloſe Hypocrites, in the mending of falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; an honeſt heart vvould not bee falſe to God, though God ſhould not ſee him, hee loves God, hee is the friend of God, and you knovv a friend vvill bee true to his friend, as vvell abſent from him as preſent vvith him, vvhen hee ſees him not, as vvell as vvhen his eyes are on him.

Some peecing and patching up vvill not ſerve the turn, but thou muſt have a nevv making, before thou bee better. There is no mending the ſtream, till there bee an healing of the fountain. The fountain and ſpring within thee is infected and corrupted, the heart is unſound, and what can bee expected from an unclean heart, but unclean acts? from an unſound ſpirit, but unſound ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices? and therefore this muſt bee made new before ever you bee cured. Thou muſt have a new Judgement, for thou ſeeſt by a falſe light. Thou muſt have a new will, for this is corrupt. Thou muſt have a new heart, for this is deſperately wicked. I tell thee, there is no mending thee, but by new making thee. You may go and patch up your ſelves, but it is but like the putting of a new peece of cloth into an old garment, it breaks out again, and the rent will bee made worſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <note place="margin">4. Means.</note>4. Is Prayer, which is <hi>inſtar omnium.</hi> Oh! deſire God with <hi>David,</hi> to make thy heart ſound in his Statutes, ſound in Prayer, ſound in hearing, ſound in obedience. That all thou doeſt may ariſe from right Principles, have a right riſe, go by a right rule, and bee directed to a right end. Pray that God would give thee ſound Principles, and ſound purpoſes. That that little mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace hee implanteth in thee, may bee accompanied with abundance of ſincerity and truth of heart.</p>
                     <p>And having gotten a ſincere heart, let it bee your care to fence and guard your heart againſt Hypocriſy.</p>
                     <p>I will give you but one preſervative which is this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Before you go upon any duty, clear the ſincerity of your hearts, make your end as high as may bee. Set out aright, looſe off well, begin in God, in Gods ſtrength, in Gods grace, in Gods aſſiſtance. A good beginning, will make as good a cloſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When thou art upon the duty, then look to thy heart, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no baſe, no by-ends to ſteal in, to poiſon all thou doeſt. Keep thine eye ſtedfaſt upon God in the doing of the duty. Do the duty as if there were no men, no hopes, no fears, no rewards in the World, as if none but God and thou were in the World.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Afterwards when the duty is done, if there hath been any thing, if God have quickened, inlarged, inflamed, humbled thy heart, give God all the glory. Beware leaſt it bee with thee, as it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> and his company, that when a fire is kindled, a viper come out of the heat. Hath God kindled a fire in thy heart, warmed, inflamed thy ſpirit? Oh! beware that a viper come not out of the heat, a viper of pride, of vain glory. Know this, they that ſeek Gods glory in the work, will give God the glory, when the work is done. If then there have been any
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:97371:202"/> good, let God inherit all the glory; but if any evil, take it to thy ſelf, for it came from thee, and let it bee thy work to lament it, to bee humbled for it.</p>
                     <p>And now this Rule will bee of ſpecial uſe. There are four uſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This will fence thy heart, guard and ſtrengthen thy heart againſt Hypocriſy; this will keep out Hypocriſy, here is no place of entrance for it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It will keep down Hypocriſy; for Hypocriſy gets no ground ſo long as it is ſeen and mourned for.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This clears the heart in the main, that thou art no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, though there may bee Hypocriſy in thee, yet being ſeen, fought againſt, mourned for, reſiſted; it reigns not, it ſhall not denominate thee an Hypocrite.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It will clear thee of the ſin of Hypocriſy; God will never charge thee for that which thou chargeſt thy ſelf withall; hee will not impute that to thee which thou imputeſt to thy ſelf. That which is thy miſery, God will never impute to thee as ſin. Hypocriſy ſeen, mourned for, ſighed under, reſiſted, fought and prayed againſt, ſhall never bee a condemning Hypocriſy. And ſo much ſhall now ſerve for the firſt branch of the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the motives to get ſincerity, with the remedies to cure Hypocriſy, and preſervatives againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Second Branch of the Exhortation is. Having gotten,<note place="margin">Clear ſincerity.</note> labour to clear this to your own ſouls, that your hearts are ſincere. It is a thing poſſible to bee cleared, a man may come to evidence to himſelf the ſincerity of his own graces and gracious performances. And it is a thing neceſſary to bee known, in reſpect of your peace, of your comfort. So neceſſary, that you can neither live with comfort, nor dye with comfort, unleſs you bee able in ſome meaſure to clear the ſincerity of your hearts, the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your ſpirits. And being a thing ſo neceſſary, I will here lay down ſome Rules and directions, for the better inabling of you to this preſent duty.</p>

                     <head>1. <hi>Rule.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Make a through and ſound ſearch, deceits lye low, Hypocriſy is ſpun of a fine thread, and is not diſcerned without diligent ſearch.</hi> A falſe evidence is the fruit of a ſuperficial ſearch. Though groſs Hypocriſy is ſeen without ſearch, yet cloſe Hypocriſy muſt bee narrowly ſearcht into, otherwiſe you ſhall not bee able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. Here you muſt not only read over your ſelves in your actions, but in your affections, not only in your practiſes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in your Principles. Hypocriſy lyes low, it is a root ſin, <hi>The heart of man is deceitful above meaſure,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>who knows it?</hi> Jer. 17.9. like a creſted picture, on the one ſide an Angel, on the other a Devil. And I muſt tell you, that ſin lyes at the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:97371:203"/> bottome of a deceitful heart, and therefore it will ask ſome pains to diſcover it. It was a fair ſpeech of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 5.29. Whatever the Lord ſhall ſay unto us, wee will do. And it may bee they meant as they ſpake for the time, they were not aware of deceit in their hearts. But hee that ſaw fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into them, than they into themſelves, diſcovered deceit to lye at the bottome, below, which they were not aware of, and therefore it follows, O that there were ſuch an heart in my people! alas! it is but a preſent pang of conſcience, there is no ſuch heart in them. So it was well ſpoken of <hi>Hazael,</hi> 2 King. 8.12, 13. when <hi>Eliſha</hi> told him what bloody cruelties hee ſhould exerciſe towards <hi>Iſrael. Is thy ſervant a Dog,</hi> ſaith hee, hee thought the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did him a great deal of wrong; what, ſhould ever hee exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſuch beaſtly cruelty? but hee ſaw not the bottome of his heart, as was ſeen after in the next Chapter. So it was well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.6, 7.20, 21. When the Princes deſired <hi>Jeremy</hi> to inquire of the Lord, whether they ſhould go, and bound themſelves with an oath to obey, whitherſoever God bade them go, they would go. But there was a deceit lay low, they had a ſecret reſolution to go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thought God would have ſent them thither, and then they would have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for an obedient people. But when the meſſage came contrary, they ſhewed the falſeneſs and hollowneſs of their ſpirit, and fall into flat contradiction againſt the word of the Lord. The word that thou haſt ſpoken wee will not do. And therefore ſeeing the heart is ſo exceedingly deceitfull, there is great need of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſearch and tryal of our ſpirits. If you take the firſt verdict the heart gives up, you are likely to bee deceived, and therefore wee are to obſerve the Apoſtles Rule, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>to examine and prove;</hi> that is, not only to examine, and ſo take the firſt Evidence the heart gives up, but prove the Evidence, whether it bee true or no. Deceits lye low. As for example.</p>
                     <p>Enquiry is made whether I have Faith, &amp;c.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Labour to acquaint thy ſelf with the moſt ſure and clearing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of ſincerity, and try thy heart by them.</hi> It may bee, thou heareſt the Word, and perhaps with joy, thou bewaileſt ſin, and perhaps with tears; thou avoideſt groſs ſins with care, thou op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſt common corruptions with zeal. All theſe are comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſignes, but they are not infallible evidences of Grace. For what is in all this which <hi>Ahab,</hi> which <hi>Saul,</hi> which <hi>Herod,</hi> which <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> had not? It is a great deal of wiſdome in the tryal of our ſelves, to bee acquainted with thoſe ſorts of evidences, which are of a clearing nature, of which I will give you two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Thoſe Evidences which are clearing, are ſuch as the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:97371:203"/> Word doth countenance; What ever evidences the Word doth not countenance, they are but the preſumptions of our own heart, and never give us comfort in life or death. It is the book muſt caſt us, or clear us, at the laſt day.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond property of clearing evidences. They muſt bee ſuch as are univerſally reciprocal, diſtinctive evidences. That is, ſuch evidences as are incompatible with any whoſe hearts are not ſincere, and concomitant with them whoſe hearts are ſincere. They muſt bee ſuch as are eſſential to a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian. If there bee any who hath them, and is not a Chriſtian, is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, or any, who is a Chriſtian ſincere, and hath them not, they are not right. They muſt bee ſuch as do manifeſt every perſon in whom they are to bee ſincere, and do diſcover, where ever they are not, what ever ſhews they have, they are not ſincere.</p>
                     <p>I have told you formerly on another ſubject, that what ever another man may do or have, and yet not bee in Chriſt, yet not bee ſincere, will never bee a ſufficient evidence to mee, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or doing that, I am ſincere. And by theſe two properties there will bee a great deal caſt down from being clearing eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if I had time to inſiſt on them. Thou prayes, thou hears, thou doſt much in the ways of God, but this will not bee enough to clear thy ſincerity, for I have ſhewed you that a man may do all this, and more too, yet not ſincere, and therefore theſe will bee no clearing evidences. And therefore let us go by this rule, examine what are thoſe clearing evidences of your ſincerity, and examine your ſelves by them.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But how ſhall I know what are thoſe heart-clearing evidences, that ſo I may examine my ſelf by them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſhewed you ſome properties, you ſee of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of this nature. I have alſo caſt down many from being ſufficient to clear your ſincerity. Wee will now give you ſome which are clearing evidences.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Some taken from the diſpoſition of mourning.<note place="margin">Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in 1. Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in part of Sin.</note>

                     <p n="1">1 An Hypocrite cannot mourn for all ſin, it may be hee may mourn for general, for common, and ſenſuall ſinnes, but not for cloſe, ſpiritual and ſecret ſinnes, his unbeleef, his hypocriſy, pride.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 An hypocrite cannot mourn for ſin as ſin; for ſin in its own nature, but as clad with wrath and puniſhment. Now then, if God have given thee a heart to mourn for all ſins, and for ſin as ſin; it is an evidence of thy ſincerity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 An hypocrite cannot mourn for the want of fulneſs of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.<note place="margin">2 Of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces want.</note> 2 Nor can hee mourn for want of any Ordinance, out of diſcovery of the beauty and excellency in them. Now then, if God give thee a heart to mourn for, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 An Hypocrite cannot mourn for ſins of others,<note place="margin">3 In ſin of others.</note> nor 2 for the want of growth in himſelf. If therefore God hath given thee ſuch
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97371:204"/> a heart &amp;c. thou muſt conclude thine own ſincerity.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 Hee cannot deſire the death of any ſin, as ſin, but for other reſpects. If therefore God hath given thee a heart deſirous to bee purged, as well as pardoned, that deſires the death of all, and of ſin, as ſin, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Again in point of deſire of grace. 1 An Hypocrite doth not deſire all grace, there are ſome he would not own, hee loves not univerſal exactneſſe. 2 Hee deſires not any grace as grace, in its own native beauty and excellency, but at times, death, &amp;c. and then as a ſtalking horſe. If therefore God hath given thee a heart to deſire and thriſt after all grace, exact conformity to God in all things, and to deſire grace, as grace, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <note place="margin">Of Affections. 1 To God.</note>3 <hi>For matters of affections.</hi> 1 An Hypocrite cannot love God for himſelf. 2 Hee cannot love God as God, as in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo contrary.

                     <p n="1">1 An Hypocrite hee loves not all the Saints, ſome hee may, not all. 2 Hee loves not the Saints as the Saints, but for other reſpects. If therefore God hath given thee a heart to love all Saints, poor godlineſs, as well as rich, grace in ruſſet and gray, as well as grace in Silks, &amp;c. And to love them as Saints, as having the image of Chriſt on them. To have communion with them, to love brotherly communion, to love them moſt, where you ſee moſt grace, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>So for hatred.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He hates not all ſin. 2 He hates no ſin, as ſin, if any at all. Now if God hath given thee a heart, &amp;c.</p>

If then God hath given thee a heart to do all this, theſe are ſpeciall evidences.</p>

If thou ſeek for an evidence when thy ſpirit is

                     <p n="4">4 <hi>Judge not of the ſincerity of thy ſpirit by ſome particular acts.</hi> But let the conſtant frame of your ſpirits and general converſation diſcover it. If particular actions might determine the caſe, wee ſhould ſometime conclude thoſe unſound, who are ſincere, and them ſincere, who are yet unſound. You may look upon a child of God, and ſee him ſometimes to have his planetical and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant motions, <hi>though the conſtant courſe and bent of his ſpirit bee Godward.</hi> We read of <hi>David</hi> murthering, and committing adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, fearful ſins! Wee read of <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſwearing, <hi>Job</hi> curſing the day of his Nativity, falling out with his ſtars, <hi>Jonah</hi> vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Peter</hi> denying, <hi>Thomas</hi> not beleeving. And if you judge by the particular Acts, though exceeding bad, you will condemn the generation of the juſt.</p>
                     <p>On the Contrary, you ſhall ſee <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſiring the prayer of <hi>Moſes, Balaam</hi> in a good mood, <hi>deſiring to dye the death of the righteous, Saul</hi> condemning of himſelf, <hi>Ahab</hi> humbling of himſelf, <hi>Ninevey</hi> repenting, <hi>Foelix</hi> trembling, <hi>Herod</hi> hearing <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> joyfully. And if we now judge by theſe particular actions, though ſeemingly good, wee ſhall juſtify thoſe whom God condemns.</p>
                     <p>Wee have a maxime in Logick, that no general Rule can bee ſtabliſhed upon a particular inſtance; and another, that no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtance can overthrow a general rule. So here, as no man can ſafely conclude from no better premiſes, than from ſome few actions, though in themſelves materially and ſubſtantially good, that the heart is therefore ſincere. So on the contrary, no man ought to conclude, becauſe of ſome planetical and extravagant motions, that a mans heart is unſound. We are not to judge of ſincerity, by ſome particular actions good or evil, but wee are to take up our judgement of our ſelves by the general frame, bent and diſpoſition of a mans heart, together with his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and conſtant converſation in the ways of God, and this will beſt diſcover our ſelves to our ſelves.

                     <p n="5">5 <hi>The fifth Rule whereby we ſhall be inabled to clear the ſincerity of our hearts, is; Be carefull to read your ſpirits,</hi> and take exact notice of your hearts at ſometimes more eſpecially. God in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his Providence, doth ſingle out ſome ſpecial times, wherein hee diſcovers the hypocriſy of the unſound, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the ſincerity of his own. It is very ſeldome that God doth ſuffer a man to end his days, before hee have tryed him, and ſo diſcovered him one way or another. The young man in the Goſpel went on fairly for a long time, and it is like, thought his condition good enough, but at laſt you ſee, Chriſt put him to the tryall, and by that diſcovered to him the unſoundneſſe of his heart. <hi>Herod</hi> hee went on fairely for a time, hee heard <hi>John,</hi> hee heard him often; hee heard him gladly, nay, and reformed too in many things, but at laſt God diſcovered his unſoundneſs, God uncaſed him, and made known the deceit of his heart. So <hi>Saul</hi> went on for a while, but at laſt God diſcovered him, So <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Balaam.</hi> And as God hath times for the diſcovery of Hypocriſy in the wicked, ſo hee hath ſome ſpecial times and occaſions, wherein he doth diſcover the ſincerity of his own people. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a holy man, but hee had the time of his tryall, hee might have been eſteemed the ſonne of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Daughter, have enjoyed all the plenty and honour of the Court; but hee refuſed to bee called the ſon of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſleighted, all that honour, and choſe rather to ſuffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon, here was the diſcovery of his ſincerity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> hee was a holy man, but yet he paſſed through times of tryall too. And they were great ones. To name but one, <hi>God commanded him to offer up his ſon in ſacrifice,</hi> here was a triall, a great triall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Had hee been only to have parted with a dutiful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, it had been ſomething, but to part with a Son, that is more.</p>

Yet herein <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed Gods command, and therin ſhewed his ſincerity. When the Precept of tryal might ſeem to contradict the Precept of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, when his dutiful Obedience to the one, might ſeem to ſpeak his undutifulneſs to the other; yet herein hee declared his ſincerity. Whereupon God tells him, now I know thou loves mee, when now thou haſt made it known, now thou haſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy ſincerity, ſeeing thou haſt not with-held thy only ſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. here was ſincerity, <hi>now I know thou feareſt God.</hi> The like I might inſtance in <hi>Job,</hi> in <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Mordecai,</hi> they had their diſcovering times, times of tryal. So that God doth ſtill ſingle out ſome ſpecial times wherein hee diſcovers the ſincerity of his own people. And if you would bee ever able to clear your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerities, read the carriage of your hearts at theſe ſpecial times. One quarter of an hour may give a man ſurer evidence of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity or hypocriſy, than all the time of his life beſides.</p>

Such like diſpoſitions do now break forth in a ſincere heart, in the times of greateſt darkneſs, which in times of clearer manifeſtation have no occaſion to ſhew themſelves. And theſe are the moſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt evidences of your ſincerity, which perhaps you ſhall ever meet withall in your lives. As wicked men do diſcover their greateſt corruptions in their higheſt advancements; ſo Gods people do diſcover, and exert, and put forth the higheſt acts of grace in their loweſt and meaneſt conditions. As the Sun ſhews
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:97371:206"/> greateſt glory when it is loweſt, when ſetting. So, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As Chriſt ſet out the greateſt acts of divinity in his loweſt abaſements, then hee ſealed up the beams of the Sun, rent rocks, graves open, the earth trembles, &amp;c. So the Saints, &amp;c. This is that the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>unto the upright there ariſeth light in darkneſs.</hi> Where the heart is unſound, it is dark in the greateſt light; ſo on the contrary, there is light in the greateſt darkneſs. Hypocriſy is like painted windows which let in no light; ſincerity is like windows of Glaſs.</p>

See how your hearts and ſpirits work towards God, and towards ſin in times of light, and clearer manifeſtations of God. Where the heart is unſound, comfort doth him no good, hee will do ſomething in a ſtorm, then perhaps pray, &amp;c. but hee will do nothing in a calm. Comforts make him more careleſs, more looſe, more remiſs in his Chriſtian way. Where on the contrary, hee who hath a ſound ſpirit, as hee is carried ſtrongly towards God, when hee with-holds his manifeſtations: ſo if God do but let in a beam of his Countenance into his ſoul, hee rejoyceth more in it, than in a World. Nay, and theſe comforts do quicken him to further duty, hee cannot lye at anchor, but hee muſt launch out into the deep, and lay out himſelf, his parts, his abilities, &amp;c. I have ſometimes told you that quickneſs and comfort may bee ſeparated, a man may have comfort without quickneſs, hee may have joy without life. But quickening was never ſeparated from comfort. A man cannot have joy, but there will bee life, &amp;c. Affections are like tinder, and Comfort like ſparks, not a ſpark of comfort can fall upon the heart, but the whole ſoul is ſet a fire, and carried ſtrongly on after God. Comforts from God ever lead the ſoul to communion with God.</p>

                     <p>To exhort them whoſe hearts are ſincere, that they would declare the ſincerity of their hearts on all occaſions. I have told you, that God hath ſpecial times for the tryal and diſcovery of the ſincerity of his own people. And it ſhould be our wiſdomes to take notice of thoſe times and ſeaſons, and our care at thoſe times to declare our ſincerity. <hi>Balaam</hi> had once a time to declare his ſincerity, when hee was hired with wealth and honor, to curſe the People of God; but not approving himſelf at that time, hee was branded for an hypocrite for ever. <hi>Saul</hi> had once a time to diſcover his ſincerity, <hi>when hee was commanded to go and ſlay all;</hi> but miſſing that time of declaring ſincerity, hee is branded, &amp;c. The young man had a time too, <hi>when Chriſt propounded to him, to part with all and follow him,</hi> but miſſing that, not taking time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſincerity, &amp;c. <hi>Solomon</hi> had a time too, but he was too neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectfull, and what follows? hee is queſtioned whether ever ſaved or no, he is pictured between heaven and hell, as if men knew not where to fix him. Theſe had all ſpecial times afforded to them of declaring their ſincerity, and like vile wretches, they make them times of diſcovering Hypocriſy. And there is not a man of you, but God doth afford you ſome or ſpecial other occaſions in your lives of declaring the ſincerity of your hearts, which if God give wiſdome to diſcern of, and a heart to cloſe with, you will bee happy; but if not, you will ſmart for it. God may ſuffer you to lye and roar upon your death-bed, for want of an evidence of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:97371:207"/> ſincerity, becauſe you are neglective of declaring your Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when God affords you an occaſion of it. Oh what ſad thoughts will theſe bee, when thou ſhalt look upon thy life, and think with thy ſelf, Such a time I was in ſuch a place, in ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, had ſuch an opportunity to ſhew my ſelf for God, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his glory, to do good to his Church, his people, his cauſe, and yet vile wretch I neglected it, I bawked it, I was unſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or I uſed my power, my ſtrength, my authority, as an Engine againſt God, againſt his people, againſt his cauſe, this will be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a witneſs.</p>
                     <p>Well then, if you would prevent this, let every one in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places and ſtations, declare the Sincerity of their hearts. Make your places your power, your parts, your riches, your friends, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to God, to his Church, to his Cauſe. As Chriſt made all his Aſcenſions for the good of his Church, ſo do you. Think it not much to adventure and hazard any thing for the glory of God, the good of the Church. Pray for the Church, act for the Church, do for God, ſuffer for God, run this brave adventure to hazard all for the good of the Church of God. Hee who raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up Gods glory, though by the ruines of himſelf; hee who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth Gods cauſe, though himſelf lye low for it, ſhall never be looſer by it, hath bargain good enough. You know thoſe places, <hi>Hee who prizeth father and mother, riches, lands, before mee, is not worthy of mee.</hi> Again, <hi>There is no man forſaketh father, or mother, riches, or lands, for my ſake, &amp;c. but ſhall have a hundred fold, &amp;c.</hi> So, <hi>Who ſaves his life, ſhall looſe it, but hee who looſes his life, &amp;c.</hi> So, <hi>Hee who denies me before men, him will I deny.</hi> It is now a time wherein wicked men do ſhew their corruptions, do you make uſe of it, as a time to ſhew your graces; when they diſcover their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy, do you declare your ſincerity. I have looked and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to ſee thoſe men who have ſtood firm in the times of affliction of a Church, ſhould ſtagger and fall back in the times of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church. It is not ſo ſtrange for a man to fall in the times of the declining of a Church: Then fear may make men ſtagger, as in <hi>Peter.</hi> But that is a corrupt heart indeed, corrupt with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who falls back, and flyes off, in the times of reforming of a Church, to ſee men to fall back not in the times of perſecution, but in the times of reformation, this is a ſad thing. It may be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace, which occaſions a man to decline and fall back in the times of perſecution; but it is a wickedneſſe, and height of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it ſhews a ſpirit oppoſite to God and goodneſſe, to bee worſe in times of reformation. Wee ſee it ſo in many in our times, and ſeeing unſound ſpirits to diſcover their corruptions, let Gods people now diſcover their graces. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> halted between God and <hi>Baal,</hi> making a mixture of divine worſhip and idolatrous together, one to bee ſet off by the other, that poiſon might bee ſwallowed down without ſcrupling; then did <hi>Elijah</hi> take occaſion

                  <p>And no doubt, but they had their <hi>Solemn Feaſts,</hi> and times of <hi>Praiſes,</hi> when God had wrought his deliverances.</p>
                  <p>The want of Mercy ſends us to <hi>Prayer;</hi> the injoyment of Mercy ſends us to <hi>Praiſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what need wee ſeek further for an inſtance? you ſee here it was the practiſe of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former Chapter tells you of his <hi>Dangers</hi> and <hi>Fears:</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> purſued him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. Together with <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and demeanour, in theſe ſtraits, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Where firſt you ſee his <hi>Faith, verſ.</hi> 13, 14. And the 15th. verſe implies his <hi>Prayer.</hi> Though wee read of none expreſſed, yet there is one implied. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>wherefore cryeſt thou unto mee? ſpeak unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that they go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> By which is implied, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſpirit did mightily wreſtle with God in Prayer, although wee read not of any words hee there uttered.</p>
                  <p>And in this Chapter you may read of his praiſes for that great deliverance which God had wrought for them. No ſooner was hee come to ſhoar, but hee ſingeth forth the praiſes of God, both for their own deliverance, and the enemies deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>So that theſe words that I have read unto you, they are a <hi>part of a Pſalm of Thankſgiving,</hi> for the glorious and wonderful delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Children of</hi> Iſrael from the hoſt of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1 For the firſt of theſe, <hi>That God doth do great wonders for his Church,</hi> even ſuch things as are above our thoughts, above our hopes, above our expectations, above our reaſon to conceive, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our faith to beleeve.</p>
                     <p>The whole Scriptures are but the <hi>Annals,</hi> or the records of the wonders which God hath done for his Church and people. You can all tell me, what wonders God did for his people in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells you ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.12. <hi>Marvellous things did hee for them, in the ſight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt.</hi> And
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:97371:211"/> you know what wonders hee did for them at the Red-ſea, when there was nothing but death before them, death behind them, they were ſurrounded with death. Yet then God unbared his arm, and cauſed the Red-ſea to divide it ſelf,<note place="margin">Vehiculum. Sepulchrum.</note> which became a paſſage to the one, and a grave to the other.</p>
                     <p>And wonders hee did for them in the wilderneſs. Not a day without a wonder; Every day was the <hi>Birth of a wonder. Hee gave them bread from heaven: he gave them water out of the rock.</hi> Read the 78 <hi>Pſalm</hi> at your leaſure, and the 9. chap. of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and in them you ſhall ſee a little Chronicle of the great wonders, which God hath done for his Church and people.</p>
                     <p>But to the Doctrin, <hi>That God doth do wonders for his Church and people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 God hath wonderfully diſappointed great plots, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate counſels, and deſigns againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Wee will give you an inſtance of this in <hi>Hamans</hi> time. <hi>Haman</hi> had a deſperate plot for the ruine of the Church and people of God, you may read it in the 3d. of <hi>Eſther</hi> 8, 9, 10. to the end. In brief, it was this: <hi>To overthrow and put to death all the Jews, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that they kept not the Kings laws.</hi> Here was their plot.</p>
                     <p>The diſappointment of it you ſhall read in the 6. 7, 8. Chapters. The means whereby this deſign was broken, was but ſmall, and therefore the greater was the wonder, the more viſible was the hand of God. <hi>The breaking of the Kings ſleep, was the breaking of this deſign,</hi> as you read, <hi>Eliſh.</hi> 6. beginning — <hi>The King could not ſleep well,</hi> what then? Could hee not lye ſtill in his bed? No, he muſt have a book, and that book, the book of <hi>Chronicles:</hi> and that Book muſt bee opened; where accidentally, (though ſurely guided by Providence) hee opens and reads that paſſage recorded concerning <hi>Mordecai,</hi> where was regiſtred his faithfullneſſe in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and diſappointing of a murther intended againſt the King. Wherupon God ſet this act of faithfulneſs ſo cloſe upon the Kings heart, that hee could not reſt till <hi>Mordecai</hi> was rewarded for it. And this reward muſt be <hi>Hamans</hi> ruine, his advancement, <hi>Hamans</hi> abaſement. And this was the riſe of <hi>Hamans</hi> diſappointment.</p>
                     <p>The like you have, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.4, 5. There was a great deſign the Nobles had againſt <hi>Daniel.</hi> They ſaw <hi>Daniel</hi> was faithfull to the King, and they could find no way to inſnare him, unleſſe it were in ſomething that concerned the law of his God. And therein, if they could find any thing in his obedience to God, that might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him diſobedient to the King; they ſhould then have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of him.</p>
                     <p>And therefore their Plot was this, <hi>To make a Decree, that who ever ſhould ask any Petition either of God, or man, for the ſpace of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>y dayes, ſave only of the King, he was to be thrown into the den of Lyons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well; the Plot took according to the Deſire of their hearts: for notwithſtanding this decree, <hi>Daniel made his Prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:97371:211"/> to his God, three times a day,</hi> as you ſee in the 10, 11. verſes.</p>
                     <p>Upon this they go and tell the King: <hi>Haſt not thou, O King, made a Decree, that none ſhould ask any Petition of God or man, ſave of thee? &amp;c. Here is one Daniel of the Captivity, who regards not thee O King, nor the decree thou haſt ſigned: But makes his Supplication three times a day,</hi> verſ. 13.</p>
                     <p>And what was this now, but to render him to the King, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſeditious, a Rebel, a Traytor, One who cared not for King, nor Law? Though indeed <hi>Daniel</hi> was a better ſubject than the beſt of them; though they would have rendred him rebellious to the King, becauſe he was obedient to his God.</p>
                     <p>But mark the iſſue of it. God diſappointed them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and brought their own plot upon their own Pates. <hi>Daniel</hi> was preſerved by the Lyons that ſhould have deſtroy'd him, as they did afterward them. The like of the three Children.</p>
                     <p>I might go down to our days, The Powder-plot: Eighty-Eight: and God knows how many ſince.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>God hath wrought wonderfull deliverance for his Church.</hi> Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances wonderful, and the way he hath wrought them was,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Sometimes by ſmall means. For weakneſſe and ſtrength is all one with God; as <hi>Aſa</hi> confeſſed, when that Great <hi>Army</hi> came againſt him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. <hi>It is all one with thee, to help with many or with few.</hi> Infinite wiſdome and power knows no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. As the Mariner turns about the greateſt ſhip with a ſmall rudder.</p>
                     <p>No means can bee ſo contemptible; but he can make it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful to his own purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>As the greateſt means will bee no priviledge, without Gods concurrence: ſo the ſmalleſt means ſhall be no prejudice, if God wil concur.</p>
                     <p>Wee read, God hath ſometimes armed natural Cauſes, Sunne, Moon, Stars, Hail, Wind: All which, were wonders, againſt the enemies of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Stars in their courſe were ſaid to fight againſt <hi>Siſera.</hi> The Lord ſlew the enemies of <hi>Joſhua</hi> with Hail; and the <hi>Moabites</hi> with the Sun ſhining upon the water.</p>
                     <p>And wee read in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical History,</hi> that the Chriſtians, being to fight againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> were in a great diſtreſſe for water: And upon their Prayer, God ſent them abundance of rain, to refreſh their Army: But incountred their enemys with Thunder and fire from heaven. In remembrance of which, the <hi>Romans</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Chriſtian Legion <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And ſometimes God hath armed other cauſes, putting ſtrength into weak and contemptible means, for the deliverance of his Church. God hath oftentimes delivered his Church by
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:97371:212"/> ſuch inſtruments, as the enemies before would have looked upon with ſcorn, as upon caſt and deſpicable Creatures.</p>
                     <p>As God hath weakned and infatuated them, hee hath intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtroy: ſo hath hee ſtrengthned and guided with a ſpirit of wiſdome, ſuch as hee hath intended for the deliverance of a Church.</p>
                     <p>You ſee <hi>Cyrus</hi> comparatively a weak <hi>Prince;</hi> yet God made him an inſtrument to overthrow the moſt ſtrong and puiſſant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World, the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and <hi>by him</hi> to <hi>deliver</hi> his <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Deborah a Woman;</hi> and yet God raiſed her up for the deliverance of his Church.</p>
                     <p>So you ſee God doth it <hi>by ſmall means.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes God works the deliverance of his Church without means.</hi> And this is more wonderful.</p>
                     <p>When God looks about and ſees <hi>there is no man, then doth his right hand bring ſalvation.</hi> When the Channel of <hi>Creature-helps</hi> is dry, when the ſtream of <hi>ſecond cauſes</hi> doth not runne: Then doth God himſelf ſtand up for the defence and deliverance of his Church and People; and creates deliverance out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>What God doth by <hi>means,</hi> hee can do <hi>alone.</hi> What hee doth <hi>mediately,</hi> hee doth ſometimes <hi>immediately</hi> from himſelf. <hi>The Angel ſlew an hundred foureſcore and five thouſand,</hi> 2 King. 19.35.</p>
                     <p>Wee read, when <hi>Julian</hi> went to war againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> hee vowed to his <hi>Idol-Gods,</hi> that when hee returned, hee would give them a ſacrifice of all the <hi>Chriſtians in the Empire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here was now no <hi>means</hi> for the deliverance of the Church. But God undertaketh the work himſelf, <hi>ſmiting him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with an unknown blow,</hi> and by that delivered his Church.</p>
                     <p>The like alſo of <hi>Maximius,</hi> and of <hi>Herod,</hi> Act. 12.23. Though there bee <hi>weakneſs below,</hi> yet there is <hi>ſtrength above:</hi> Though <hi>means</hi> bee <hi>wanting,</hi> yet hee can <hi>create means,</hi> or hee can work <hi>without. God and Faith, work beſt alone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Sometimes God works the deliverance of his Church by contrary means.</hi> And this is yet a more wonderful way.</p>
                     <p>God doth often work his works <hi>by Contraries,</hi> hee brings <hi>good</hi> out of <hi>evil, Life</hi> out of <hi>Death, &amp;c.</hi> As the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> doth order poiſons and deſtructive ingredients to phyſical, uſeful, and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purpoſes: So thoſe things which in themſelves are againſt us, God in ſingular wiſdome and mercy, turns them for us. That which hath been uſed as the <hi>means of ruine,</hi> hath God often turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>means of raiſing</hi> a Church and People.</p>
                     <p>This is like the <hi>opening of the blind mans eyes with Clay.</hi> One would think it ſhould rather <hi>put out the eyes of a ſeeing man,</hi> than <hi>give ſight to a blind man.</hi> But if <hi>Chriſt</hi> do undertake the work, though the <hi>means</hi> bee never ſo <hi>contrary,</hi> it ſhall bee <hi>effectual.</hi>

                     <p>Thus you ſee that God doth often do wonders for the good of his Church and People.</p>

                     <p>Therefore did God execute ſuch fearful Judgements on <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> and wrought ſo great deliverances for his people; that hee might get himſelf a <hi>Name,</hi> and publiſh himſelf to the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.12.</p>

                     <p>If God ſhould only walk in the ordinary wayes of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the World; his glory would not bee ſo much ſeen and advanced: And therefore God doth often ſtep out of his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paths of Providence, and goes in <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> that hee might diſcover his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and advance his own <hi>Name.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore this was the argument which <hi>David</hi> uſed, why God ſhould deſtroy ſuch as were his enemies, and work deliverances for ſuch as were his people; <hi>That men might know, that thou, whoſe Name alone is</hi> Jehovah, <hi>art the moſt high over all the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 83.18.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. The third Reaſon, why God doth <hi>wonderful things</hi> for his Church, is, <hi>as to get, ſo to uphold his great Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You have an excellent place for this in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.27. God was highly diſpleaſed with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for their provocations of him; and hee threatned to deſtroy them: yet after all this, hee ſaith, — <hi>I ſaid, I would ſcatter them into corners, and would make the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them to ceaſe from among men: were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy: leſt their adverſaries ſhould behave themſelves ſtrangely, and leſt they ſhould ſay, our high hand, and not the Lord, hath done all this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like you have in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.35. <hi>Who are there among the Gods of the Countries, that can deliver out of my hand?</hi> ſo hee vaunted, and God ſuffered him to ſoare ſo high, that hee might have the greater praiſe, and his Glory bee higher advanced by the greater downfal of ſuch a <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this was the Argument which <hi>Moſes</hi> urged God withal, when hee threatned to deſtroy the <hi>Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Now if thou kill this people, then the Nations which have heard the fame of thee, will ſpeak, ſaying: Becauſe the Lord was not able to bring this People into the Land, which hee ſware unto them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath hee ſlain them in the Wilderneſs.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, — <hi>Thou haſt gotten thy ſelf a Name,</hi> by the mighty <hi>wonders,</hi> which thou haſt done for thy people: but if thou ſhouldeſt leave now, and do no more, thou wouldeſt loſe thy glory, which thou haſt got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,

                     </p>
                     <p>The like you have in <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.28. And in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.12. And the ſame Argument you have in <hi>Joſ.</hi> 8.9. When God went not forth with the armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but ſuffered them to bee ſmitten by their enemies. <hi>O Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſhua) what ſhall I ſay, when</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>turn their backs upon their enemies! If it bee thus, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thy great Name!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Arguing by this, that there was a <hi>neceſsity</hi> for God to <hi>do great things</hi> for his People; <hi>ſtill to uphold that great Name</hi> hee had gotten, which otherwiſe would fall to the ground, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.9. <hi>Help us, for the glory of thy Name; and deliver us for thy Names ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And an excellent place you have for this, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.9, 10, 11. <hi>For my Names ſake will I defer my wrath, and for my Praiſe will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain it from thee, that I cut thee not off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſ.

As in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18.

And hee that forgets <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> forgets the <hi>end of Gods</hi> beſtowing of Mercy, and robs himſelf of the fruit and effect of the preſent Mercy, and hinders himſelf of future.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſ. God doth wonderful things for his Church, to adde tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Devil, and his Children.</hi>

                     <p>Gods mercies and deliverances to the Saints, muſt needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Devil, and wicked men.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Haman</hi> had prevailed ſo far as to get a bloody decree againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> hee joyed exceedingly, as one that promiſed to himſelf the <hi>utter ruine of them all.</hi> Now God ſtepping in on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and ſhewing a <hi>wonder</hi> to diſappoint him in his deſign; No man can conceive, much leſs expreſs how much this added to <hi>Hamans torture and vexation.</hi> Hee <hi>goeth home, and vexeth himſelf, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his bed,</hi> and could have no reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Achitophel</hi> was ſo <hi>tortured,</hi> that his deſign did not take, that hee was <hi>impatient of his Life.</hi> Hee could not <hi>eaſe himſelf,</hi> but by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like you have of <hi>Balak</hi> God hath his wayes to make wicked men <hi>gnaſh their teeth</hi> before they come to Hell; and this is one way, to put them in a kinde of hope of having their will upon

                        <hi>David</hi> was a man of many choice experiences of Gods goodneſs to him; and hee was a man that was choice of them: hee <hi>laid them up,</hi> and made uſe of them at every need.

                     <p>It is a paſſage not to bee neglected, that when hee was forced to fly from <hi>Saul,</hi> comming to <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Prieſt, hee deſired a weapon of him, for his defence and ſafeguard. Hee told him, that there was none, ſave onely <hi>The Sword of Goliah,</hi> whom hee had ſlain, and <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>there is none like that, give it mee,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.9. This was a <hi>Trophee</hi> of Gods goodneſſe to him: It was an Enſign of a former <hi>Experience</hi> of Gods love to him: And there was no better weapon for his defence, than ſuch a one, as was both an experience and a weapon. In carrying this, he carried an <hi>Experience</hi> with him, which might <hi>Comfort</hi> him, and <hi>incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> him too.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.10. Saith the <hi>Apoſtle: hee hath delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver: In whom we truſt he will yet deliver us.</hi>

                     <p>Thus from the <hi>former Experiences of Gods goodneſs to him,</hi> hee makes out an argument of future deliverances.</p>
                     <p>And, if we were but thus wiſe, to treaſure up former <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences;</hi> the <hi>former parts of our lives</hi> would come in to <hi>help the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But the argument is good here. <hi>Hee hath-not:</hi> therefore hee <hi>will not forſake his people.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hee will bee gracious, becauſe hee hath been gracious.

                     </p>
                     <p>God blames the Iſraelites, becauſe hee had done ſo great

                     </p>
                     <p>There are four loving ingagements of God, which move him to do wonderful things for his Church,
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>They are his.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>He hath promiſed.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3. <hi>His people truſt in him.</hi>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. God is ingaged to do wonderful things for us, <hi>Becauſe wee are his.</hi> We are his people, hee is our God: wee are his Spouſe, hee our husband: wee are his children, hee our father: wee his Members, hee our head: wee are his portion, his inheritance, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And this is a great ingagement for God to do great things for us; what will not a loving father do for his child? what will not a loving Husband do for his wife? &amp;c. wee ſtand in the ſame relations with God.</p>
                     <p>He thought nothing too great to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for us. Hee ſuffered <hi>great things,</hi> and hee ſuffered <hi>cheerfully:</hi> hee was in pain till the hour came. And do you think hee will think any thing <hi>too much to do</hi> for you?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God doth</hi> what ever <hi>is done in the world.</hi> And there is nothing <hi>that he doth,</hi> that I may ſay his heart is more in, that he doth with more <hi>Complacency and delight,</hi> than thoſe things he <hi>doth for his Church and People. His whole heart is in them;</hi> and therefore doth them <hi>cheerfully,</hi> and doth them fully. As you know, whatever your <hi>heart is in,</hi> that you do willingly, that you do thoroughly, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, there was <hi>Nothing to ingage him, To make us his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; before hee made us his People,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>God choſe you, not becauſe of thy righteouſneſſe, the uprightneſs of thy heart; for thou art a ſtif-necked People. But becauſe the Lord Loved you, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there is ſomething to ingage him, <hi>To do for us now, hee hath made us his People, becauſe wee are his People,</hi> this is that, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> did comfort the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> withall, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22. <hi>The Lord will not forſake his people, for his great Names ſake,</hi> And why? what is the reaſon? what is the ingagement? why ſaith hee, <hi>Becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his people.</hi>

                        <hi>becauſe he hath ingaged himſelf to us, by many great and precious Promiſes. Gods Promiſes</hi> are <hi>ingagements</hi> upon him. God hath made himſelf our Debter, <hi>Not by receiving any thing from us, but by promiſing all things to us.</hi> God hath made many precious promiſes to us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Promiſes of Preſervation,</hi> Iſa. 33.16. <hi>Hee ſhall dwell on high:
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:97371:215"/> his place of defence ſhall bee the munition of rocks; bread ſhall bee given to him; his waters ſhall bee ſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Promiſe, than which I know none more full in the Book of God, wherein all Objections, that a fearful heart might raiſe, are anſwered and taken away. Let us view it over.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Hee ſhall dwell on high]</hi> If hee were among his enemies, hee might bee in danger: But <hi>hee ſhall dwel on high;</hi> nay, <hi>on heights,</hi> as the Word is: <hi>many Aſcents, many Heights,</hi> above the reach of danger, out of <hi>Gun-ſhot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 But ſuppoſe they could raiſe up Mounts, and come as high as hee; yet they ſhall not hurt him. <hi>Hee is in a place of defence.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3 But what then?

                     <p n="4">4 Why? but hee may bee <hi>starved out;</hi> his ſupply will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way laſt. There is no <hi>plowing and ſowing upon Rocks;</hi> hee may bee <hi>famiſht</hi> out. No ſaith the Text. <hi>Bread ſhall bee given him;</hi> Hee ſhall bee provided for.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 But what ſhall wee do for <hi>Water?</hi> There is no <hi>Water</hi> to be had out of <hi>Rocks.</hi> You ſee it was that which poſed the Faith of <hi>Moſes: to fetch Water out of a Rock.</hi> But ſaith the Text, <hi>hee ſhall have Water too.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 Yea but his <hi>Water may be ſpent.</hi> It will not <hi>alway laſt.</hi> No ſaith the Text: <hi>His Waters ſhall be ſure; never failing Waters, ſure Waters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, in the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>The Lord will bee to us a place of broad Rivers and ſtreams, wherein ſhall go no Gallie with Oares, nor ſhall gallant ſhip paſs thereby.</hi> Shewing the <hi>defence</hi> God would bee to his People. <hi>Hee will bee a Stream,</hi> nay a <hi>River</hi> between us and our enemies. And a <hi>broad River,</hi> a River that <hi>cannot bee paſsed over.</hi> Why but they may uſe <hi>Oares.</hi> No ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Hee will bee a <hi>River, wherein no Gally with Oares ſhall paſs.</hi> But a Ship may. No, <hi>nor gallant ſhip ſhall paſs thereby, for the Lord is our Judge; the Lord is our Law-giver; the Lord is our King; hee will ſave us.</hi> But what if any ſhip ſhould attempt? You ſhall ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>God will untackle them. Thy tacklings are looſed; they could not well ſtrengthen their Maſt; they could not ſpread the ſaile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as hee hath made promiſes of <hi>Preſervation from,</hi> So hee hath made promiſes of <hi>Deliverance out of trouble,</hi> Pſal. 34.19. <hi>Many are the troubles of the Righteous; but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon mee in the time of trouble; I will deliver thee.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.15. <hi>I will bee with him in trouble, and will deliver him.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. <hi>No weapon formed againſt thee ſhall proſper.</hi> And an excellent promiſe wee have, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.3, 4. <hi>I gave</hi> Egypt <hi>for thy ranſome,</hi> Ethiopia <hi>and</hi> Seba <hi>for thee.</hi> God
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:97371:216"/> ſpeaks here as the Lord and Poſſeſſor of the whole Earth, <hi>Egypt</hi> was his, and <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was his; and both theſe hee gave for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his Church.</p>
                     <p>The Church was in bondage and captivity, you know, in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And God gave <hi>Egypt</hi> for her ranſome. And how? becauſe ſhee could not bee ranſomed and delivered without the loſs of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Therefore God gave <hi>Egypt</hi> for her: That is, hee would rather loſe all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> than his people ſhould not bee ranſomed: hee would ſink the whole Kingdome of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if it ſtood betwixt his <hi>People</hi> and Deliverance. And ſo it follows in the 4. <hi>verſ. I have loved thee, therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.</hi> As if hee had ſaid. I love thee, thou art more dear to mee than all the World; and I do not ſtick to give the lives of <hi>thouſands</hi> to uphold thine. Multitudes ſhall bee deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rather than thou ſhalt not bee preſerved. <hi>I love thee, and therefore I will give men for thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee God is ingaged to do <hi>wonderful things for his Church, becauſe of his Promiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That love which hath moved him to make theſe precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to us, will never give him reſt, till it hath cauſed him to make good thoſe promiſes which hee hath made.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third loving <hi>Ingagement,</hi> which cauſes God to do <hi>wonders</hi> for his People is, <hi>becauſe they truſt in him. Truſt</hi> is a kinde of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi> upon a man, although hee had made no promiſe. A man will not deceive another, who repoſeth his whole <hi>trust</hi> in him, though hee were not <hi>ingaged</hi> by <hi>Promiſe.</hi> There is a kinde of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi> in <hi>Truſt</hi> it ſelf: And ſhall wee then think that <hi>God will, when hee hath made ſo many precious promiſes to us?</hi> This were the <hi>greateſt deceit</hi> in the World, a <hi>Soul-deceit.</hi> If God ſhould call us off from all other ſuccours, from other ſhelters, and tell us, that <hi>if wee will truſt in him, hee will bee our ſuccour, our ſecurity.</hi> And ſhould God fail the ſoul; this were an <hi>undoing-deceit,</hi> the <hi>greatest deceit</hi> in the World.</p>
                     <p>No, my Brethren, there was never man who laid up his <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in God, but hee found God to bee that to him, which hee expected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> ingageth <hi>all the Power, all the Wiſdome, all the Mercy, and Truth of God to help us.</hi> And if the <hi>Power, Wiſdome, &amp;c. of God</hi> can do <hi>wonders</hi> for thee: God will then <hi>do wonders</hi> for thee, if thou <hi>beleeve in him. Beleeve</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) and thou ſhalt ſee the wondrous works of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. A fourth <hi>Ingagement,</hi> which cauſeth God to do <hi>wonders</hi> for his People is, <hi>becauſe they ſeeke him. Hee doth not ſay to the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeek yee mee, in vain.</hi> Hee hath ſtiled himſelf — <hi>The God hearing prayers;</hi> and bids us <hi>call upon him in the day of trouble, and hee will hear.</hi> The <hi>Prayers</hi> of Gods People, they are as ſo many <hi>Ingagements</hi> upon God, to move him to do for them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> will ſet <hi>All-God awork.</hi> It will ſet the <hi>Power, Wiſdome, Mercy of God a work,</hi> for you. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mountains.</hi> Nothing ſhall bee <hi>too hard</hi> for that people to do, whoſe hearts and ſpirits God holds up to <hi>beleeve,</hi> and <hi>to pray. Bee it to thee, even as thou wilt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luther</hi> having been in his <hi>ſtudy,</hi> and earneſt with the <hi>Lord</hi> about the buſineſs of the Church; receiving a <hi>gracious anſwer,</hi> hee comes down and cryes, <hi>Wee have overcome; the day is ours.</hi> And ſo it fell out, ſaith the ſtory: <hi>For the Church prevailed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a kinde of <hi>Omnipotency</hi> in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> becauſe theſe two ſet the <hi>Omnipotent God, and the Omnipotency of the Power of the Omnipotent God, to work for us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I beleeve, <hi>The great work of Reformation hath gone ſo ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward, becauſe Gods People are not ſo ſtrongly carried on in ſeeking.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 <hi>Who hee was. Hee was the Son of God; The expreſs Image of his Fathers perſon; One equal with God; and thought it no robbery to bee equal with God; hee was God bleſſed for ever,</hi> As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſtiles him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>VVhat hee became.

                     <p n="1">1 God doth often reſtrain the wickedneſs and malice of men againſt his Church; that though they bee never ſo full of Hell and fury; yet they ſhall not bee able to vent it, againſt the Church and People of God. Thus you ſee it was with <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> when hee came with purpoſe to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet <hi>God put his hook into his noſe, and his bridle into his lips.</hi> Hee reſtrained him, as you ſee in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.28, 32, 33. And this made <hi>David</hi> to ſay, when the <hi>Princes</hi> took counſel together, to take away his life, <hi>My times are in thy hands,</hi> Pſal. 31.15. Though they bee never ſo full of malice, their deſigns bee never ſo bloody, yet <hi>my times are in thy hands; they ſhall not bee able to hurt mee:</hi> though they conſulted, yet hee knew they could not act: God could reſtrain them.</p>
                     <p>God hath the Devil, much more wicked men, in a chain; and they cannot go a jot further than hee gives them chain; and that ſhall bee no further than for <hi>his own Glory, and the good of his Church,</hi> as hee tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.10. <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall turn to thy Praiſe, and the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though wicked men bee never ſo full of wrath and fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, yet they ſhall vent no more than what ſhall turn to the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> nay, the <hi>Praiſe of God;</hi> ſo much as his People ſhall have cauſe to <hi>praiſe</hi> him for. <hi>The remainder of wrath,</hi> (though <hi>never ſo full) hee ſhall reſtrain.</hi> They ſhall <hi>burst</hi> before they ſhall <hi>vent any of it,</hi> to the hurt of his People. And this is a <hi>great wonder.</hi> His ſetting <hi>bounds</hi> to the <hi>fury</hi> of men, as hee doth to the raging of the Sea. <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no further: reſtraining the malice of men againſt the Church,</hi> is as great a <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> as to ſee a <hi>Milſtone hang in the Air, and not fall down.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>God doth often calm, and ſtill the raging fury of wicked men againſt his Church and People.</hi> Hee doth not only bound them, but ſtill them.</p>
                     <p>And thus you ſee it was with <hi>Eſau.</hi> Hee came forth with rage, and <hi>bloody-purpoſes</hi> againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> to bee revenged on him for all. But you ſee how God <hi>calmed</hi> him. In ſtead of <hi>killing him,</hi> hee <hi>falls upon his neck, and kiſſes him.</hi> It was God that did it. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.10. <hi>That</hi> Jacob <hi>ſaw the face of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, <hi>as the face of God.</hi> It was not <hi>Eſau,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> that hee ſaw
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:97371:219"/> in <hi>Eſaus</hi> face. Hee ſaw God appearing in the <hi>wonderful changing,</hi> and <hi>calming</hi> of his ſpirit, who came with ſuch fury againſt him. And this was the fruit of his wreſtling and praying the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>VVhen God doth carry on great purpoſes with weak and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Power:</hi> makes weak means ſucceſsful to do great purpoſes and effects. This is a <hi>wonder,</hi> and a <hi>wonder</hi> God often doth; as you ſee in <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 Chron. 14.11. <hi>It is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no Power.</hi> As the Mariner can turn about the greateſt ſhip with the ſmalleſt Rudder: So God, who ever ſits at the Helm, and ſteeres and governs all, can bring about his own purpoſes by weakeſt means.</p>
                     <p>As hee brought <hi>Jeremy</hi> out of the dungeon with <hi>old rotten rags, good for nothing:</hi> So hee makes uſe of ſuch means in ſtraits, for the deliverance of his Church, as the enemies thereof do look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſcorn, as upon <hi>cast and deſpicable Creatures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As God doth weaken and infatuate them, hee intends not to proſper; ſo hee ſtrengthens and guides with a ſpirit of wiſdome, thoſe hee intends for the deliverance of his Church. You ſee this in <hi>Deborah,</hi> in <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who though hee were a weak Prince, yet God made him an inſtrument for the overthrow of the <hi>moſt ſtrong and puiſſant people in the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>When hee makes the Afflictions and perſecutions of his Church, a means of growth and increaſe of his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As it was ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. 1.12. <hi>The more they were afflicted, the more they grew:</hi> ſo hath God ſtill done for his Church. The primitive times tell us of thouſands, who were brought in, not by Sermons, but by the ſufferings of the Saints. The blood of thoſe Martyrs being the ſeed of the Church.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Julian</hi> knew this ſo well, that hee left off to perſecute the Church, as his Predeceſſors had done. <hi>Non ex miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ, ſed ex invidiâ;</hi> not out of mercy, but envy, ſaith the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian; becauſe hee ſaw, <hi>The more they were afflicted, the more they grew: The more they were oppreſſed, the more they increaſed:</hi> And therefore hee left off that courſe. But the Church loſt more by Sun-ſhine, than by Storms; more by Peace, than by Troubles; by Smiles, than by Frowns.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 <hi>VVhen God ſhall bring about the Peace of his People, by the trouble of his People; their healing, by their woundings; their comforts by their fears.</hi> When God ſhall work his work by contraries; bring joy out of ſorrow, life out of death, create comfort out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts: This is a <hi>wonder;</hi> and a <hi>wonder</hi> which God hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhewed for the good of his Church.</p>
                     <p>How often hath God made the luſts of men, even the malice and rage of his enemies, to bee a means for the good of his Church and People? making thoſe things which in their own nature were for the ruine, a means for the raiſing of his Church and People.</p>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:97371:219"/>
                     <p>The ſtories of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> of <hi>Haman,</hi> and others, afford you plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proof of it. Thus, <hi>out of the Eater comes ſweetneſs:</hi> out of thoſe things <hi>deſtructive</hi> in themſelves, <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>deliverance.</hi> This is to turn poiſon into food, evil into good. As God doth turn the evil of ſin, ſo much more the evil of trouble, to the good of his Church. Hee makes all troubles ſubſervient to deliverance, as pangs and throws are to the birth.</p>
                     <p>As it was in the waters of <hi>Betheſda:</hi> the waters were troubled before the diſeaſed were healed; God made the trouble of the water ſubſervient to the cure in the water: So hee often makes the troubles of his People, ſubſervient to the growth and increaſe of his People.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>VVhale</hi> which ſwallowed up <hi>Jonah,</hi> hee made a means to bring him to the ſhoar: So that trouble which wee think will ſwallow us up, God makes to advance their peace here, till hee ſet them on the ſhoar of eternity.</p>
                     <p>Wee our ſelves have had the experience of it. But <hi>this is the Lords doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 <hi>VVhen then are nothing but thoughts and preparations for war and deſtruction:</hi> And God ſhall pleaſe <hi>to compoſe our differences, heal our breaches, change the ſad face of things; beat our ſwords into Plow-ſhares, and our ſpears into Pruning-hooks.</hi> This is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>And this is a <hi>wonder which God can do; a wonder which hee hath done; a wonder</hi> which wee have had experience of; and ſuch an one as wee are <hi>now in expectations of, which God of his mercy grant.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>And you know the greater the ſtraits out of which God doth help and deliver, the more are the hearts of the Saints inlarged with praiſes to him.

                     <p>You ſee this in the ſtory of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> God could have wrought a deliverance for them, had hee but unwheel'd his Charets, as ſoon as hee came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But it had not then been ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a deliverance as they afterward had.</p>
                     <p>Though God had delivered them from that preſent trouble, yet their enemies had been alive, and they ſhould have heard of them again. And therefore God he lets them go on, and follow them unto, nay into the Red-ſea, <hi>and then to work a compleat delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for them, he ſhews a wonder upon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like you have, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>Many Nations are gathered together againſt thee, who ſay, let her bee defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, nor underſtand they his Counſell: for hee ſhall gather them as ſheaves into the floor. Ariſe and threſh, O Daughter of Zion: for I will make thy horns iron, and thy hoofs braſſe, and thou ſhalt break in peeces, many people: and I will conſecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their ſubſtance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where obſerve, God ſuffers <hi>Nations, and many Nations to gather themſelves together againſt Sion.</hi> And why did God do ſo? certainly they thought they ſhould have the day of <hi>Zion:</hi> and ſo they ſay, <hi>Let her bee defiled, let our eye look upon Zion. But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, they underſtand not the Counſell of God.</hi> For God ſuffers them to gather themſelves together, but for this end, For the compleater ruine of the enemys, and by that, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleater deliverance of the Church. So it follows, <hi>They know not the thoughts of the Lord: for he ſhall gather them.</hi> They gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together; and yet ſaith the Text, <hi>God gathers them:</hi> They gathered themſelves to ruine the Church: and God gathers them, to ruine themſelves. <hi>Hee ſhall gather them as ſheaves into the floor,</hi> and the fuller the load, the more welcome to the Husbandman.

                     </p>
                     <p>It was ſo in the Powder-Plot: A Plot never to bee forgotten. When they had intended to have blown up, King, People, Nobles, Commons, Senators, Senate, Laws, and Law-makers; nay, three kingdomes at a blaſt: They could have buried all in one grave, and conſumed all in one Bonefire. Here was their rage, their fury. And did they not alſo promiſe to themſelves as good ſucceſſe in their way? Had they not then in their purpoſes diſpoſed of Crown and kingdom, and all the Chief Offices, and Revenues in the Land?— And now was the time for God to ſhew a wonder for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Church, which you know he did. <hi>A wonder of wiſdome in the diſcovery of the Plot,</hi> and a wonder of <hi>mercy, in diſappointing of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>When Gods People are brought low,</hi> when all humane helps fail; when the Arme of fleſh is weak, when the ſtream of ſecond Cauſes is dry. Then is Gods time to ſhew a wonder for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif; when wee cannot be releeved without a wonder; then God works wonders for our relief.</p>
                     <p>You ſee this Deut. 32.35, 36. <hi>The Lord ſhall judge his People, and repent himſelf concerning his ſervants: when hee ſeeth, that their power is gone, and there is none ſhut up, nor left.</hi>

                     <p>God is ever ready to put forth himſelf in deſperate caſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then his mercy and power will bee moſt conſpicuous, his People moſt thankfull, and deliverance moſt glorious.</p>

                     <p>The greateſt darkneſſe is before the morning watch; when the morning is darkeſt, then comes the day, when trouble is greateſt, then comes deliverance.</p>

                     <p>You ſee this in the deliverance of the Church out of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh</hi> captivity. In which deliverance God expreſſed many wonders of mercy to his Church. At which time God raiſed up <hi>A mighty Spirit of Prayer</hi> in them to ſeek. As you ſee in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2, 3.

                     <p>So, when hee doth ſtirre up the hearts of his People to ſeek him; It is an evident demonſtration, that God will do great things for that People.</p>
                     <p>Hee hath told us, that <hi>Hee will not forſake them that ſeek him;</hi> when the eyes and hearts of Gods People are big with ſorrow, then is Gods mercy big with deliverance, ready to be delivered.</p>

                     <p>Too many there are, who hate to bee reformed. Old bottles will never brook with new Wine. Nor will old hearts cloſe with a ſpiritual way.</p>
                     <p>It is now with us as the Lord complained of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Hoſ. 7.1. <hi>When I would have healed</hi> Iſrael, <hi>then the iniquity of</hi> Ephraim <hi>was diſcovered.</hi> All the while before their corruptions did lye a ſleep; they little thought there were any ſuch ſpirits in them: But when the Phyſician comes, then they appear.</p>

                     <p>But I hope wee ſhall bee like ſheep, that though a fair day hath ſcattered us all over the field, one from another; yet a ſtorm will drive us together again; ſeeing herein our concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are mutual and reciprocal.</p>

                     <p>Though wee have never a Promiſe for a particular deliverance at this time; yet wee may venture our ſelves upon the good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, <hi>That hee will not deliver us up into the hands of cruel, mercileſs, and bloody men, who ſeek our ruine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though our ſins bee many, and God might ſcourge us ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as wee deſerve; yet hee loves his People ſo well, as not to put them into the hands of ſuch cruel men to bee puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>You have ſome ground for this ſuggeſtion in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.27. When God was highly diſpleaſed with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and threatned to deſtroy them; yet <hi>hee feared the wrath of the enemy.</hi> Hee feared they would deal too hardly; that they would deſtroy them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:97371:223"/> than ſcourge them. Hee knew not how to put them into their hands, Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſinned, yet hee was loath to make uſe of ſinners to puniſh ſin: He knew the <hi>Mercyes of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were cruel mercys.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 A ſecond Argument from God is, <hi>Becauſe Gods glory is now much concern'd.</hi> It is not alone our good, but his own glory, that is concerned: and hee will have a care of that. Though hee will not do it for us, yet hee will do it for <hi>his own Names ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many things, which hee will not do for our ſakes: yet will hee for his own ſake. You ſee in Ezek. 36.32. <hi>Not for your ſakes, do I this, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> But though hee would not do it for their ſakes, yet he would do it, becauſe his glory was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; Hee would do it for his <hi>own Names ſake;</hi> you have the like expreſſions, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.9, 10, 11. Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> had provoked God, yet for his own Glory ſake he would deliver them.</p>
                     <p>And if wee do not look with two partiall eyes, I cannot ſee, that <hi>Ever the glory of God was more neerly and cloſely concern'd, in</hi> all the ſtories, I have read, than it is at this time.</p>
                     <p>Gods Glory in his Truth, in his worſhips, in his Saints, in his Ordinances; they are all neerly concern'd at this <hi>Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And how would wicked men triumph, how would our enemys inſult and glory? What pious heart could indure to hear thoſe Blaſphemies, they would caſt up againſt heaven, and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts caſt upon the People of God.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Though it bee true, wee have many fearful ſins and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations among us; And thoſe are publick too; ſuch as have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the whole land: yet theſe ſins are not national: they have not yet been countenanced by a Law.

                     <p>Which affords mee this comfort: 1. That, though theſe ſins bee in our Nation, and do abound among us: yet they are not the <hi>Sins of our Nation.</hi> There have been Laws againſt them: and ſo long they are not national.</p>
                     <p>And it hath been

                           <item>1. <hi>Either the Corruption.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Or the cowardiſe of our Magiſtrates,</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>That ſin hath not been puniſhed. I ſay, the corruption of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have ſtrengthned the hands of evil doers, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at them, ſiding with them, or abetting of them in their way. And ſo thoſe, who ſhould have been the bolts to have kept out ſin, have been the Latches to draw in ſinne, let in ſin.</p>
                     <p>Or it hath been the <hi>Cowardiſe</hi> of them, that they durſt not appear for the puniſhing of ſinne, Ezek. 22.30. <hi>I ſought for a man among them, that ſhould make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before mee, for the land; that I ſhould not deſtroy it:</hi> I ſought for a <hi>Phineas,</hi> that might ſtand up to execute Judgement, and what was there none? Certainly there were many: but they were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and durſt not appear againſt ſin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though theſe ſins were in a kind <hi>National;</hi> as indeed the Corruption and connivance of them in Authority gives too much largeneſſe to them, increaſeth the latitude of them, makes them of greater extent and guilt: yet <hi>now wee are about reforming them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And wee never read, that <hi>ever God did ruine a Nation, when a Nation was in a way of reforming.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed, that which comes neereſt to it, and that, which is the ſaddeſt peece in all the Scriptures, is in that example of <hi>Joſiah:</hi> Hee ſet upon the work of Reformation, yet God held up his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of deſtroying that people; You ſhall read it 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.26, 27. <hi>Notwithſtanding the Lord turned not from the fierceneſſe of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled againſt</hi> Judah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Notwithſtanding all that Reformation, as you may ſee in that Chapter: <hi>Yet the anger of the Lord was not turned back, but his hand was ſtretched out still;</hi> Firſt, to cut off that godly King, and afterwards to cut down that ungodly people.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But firſt I muſt tell you, <hi>That Gods decree was then paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</hi> And God had pronounced it long before, as you ſee in his meſſage to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.17. and I hope there is <hi>yet no Decree gone out againſt England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 And ſecondly, Though he would not revoke, what he had Decreed: yet this good act of <hi>Joſiah</hi> procured the <hi>Deferring of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:97371:224"/> Gods Judgements, all his days,</hi> 2 King. 22.18, 19, 20. <hi>But to the King of</hi> Judah, <hi>thus ſhall yee ſay to him, Behold, I will gather thee to thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evill that I will bring upon this place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that this is yet ſtrong. <hi>God did never deſtroy a Nation at any time, when his People were about the Reforming of that Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it hath pleaſed God at this time, to ſet us up a choice Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. <hi>An Aſſembly choſen by Prayer, brought together by Prayer, and held together, and preſerved to this day, by the might of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And their ſpirits have been held up amidſt many difficulties and ſtrong oppoſitions, to <hi>Hazard themſelves, their lives, and eſtates, for the good of our ſouls, our bodyes, nad eſtates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I ſay, it was never heard of, nor read of: It is an untracted caſe, that God ſhould deſtroy a <hi>Nation, whileſt they are ſuch, whom hee hath himſelf ſingled out, and ſet up for the Reforming of a Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If hee would have deſtroyed us, hee would never have been at the pains to Reform us. One cannot ſtand with the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A third <hi>Argument from our ſelves. And that is taken from the beginnings of mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You know what our Condition hath been before, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it is freſh. God at that time did hear the cry of our ſouls, and pittyed us in our low eſtate, and did go forth in the beginnings of mercy to us. And may wee not Reaſon; if God would have <hi>deſtroyed</hi> us, he would never have done thus much for us.</p>
                     <p>That which God hath done is an earneſt unto us, and an ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon God, <hi>To go on in the finiſhing of what he hath begun to do for us already.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Shall wee think, hee hath brought us out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to deſtroy us in the Wilderneſſe? Shall wee think, the Sun of Mercy hath ſhined on us, but only to warm our heads againſt a ſtorm? ſhall wee think, hee hath exalted us thus high, that hee might lay us the lower in the end?</p>
                     <p>Indeed thus God hath done with the wicked. But wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read that hee hath ſo done with his own people.</p>
                     <p>Shall wee think hee hath delivered us from leſſer, to reſerve us to greater Judgements? Freed us from Rods, to whip us with Scorpions? delivered us from leſſer evils, to ruine us at once? this cannot bee I think, though the appearances were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt us than they are.</p>
                     <p>Thus God may do with wicked men; but thus God did never do with his own.</p>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:97371:225"/>
                     <p>A fourth Argument taken from our ſelves, to induce us to Hope, that God will do a <hi>wonder</hi> for us, is, There is a ſtock of Prayers going out, and laid up for the good of this Church and Nation.</p>
                     <p>Many Prayers have been made. And I tell you, all the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits in the World are now at work for <hi>England.</hi> Who hath a tongue, and doth not ſpeak? who hath a hand, and doth not ſtretch it out? and I tell you, this is ſomething conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>If the Prayer of one <hi>Moſes</hi> could do ſo much; what will the prayers of ſo many thouſands? What? hath God heard <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Scotland?</hi> and <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Ireland?</hi> and will hee not hear <hi>England</hi> for it ſelf? that were ſtrange. Shall they ſave all others, but their own ſouls?</p>
                     <p>Indeed wee ſometimes read, that praying ſpirits could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to ſave others: but yet they ſaved their own ſouls. As God ſaid; <hi>Though</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>were in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they ſhould not deliver Son nor Daughter; they ſhould only bee delivered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> Ezek. 14.20. But wee never read, that they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to ſave others, and yet not bee able to ſave their own ſouls. Will God then hear us for others, not for our ſelves? would a friend grant you a requeſt for another? and deny the ſame to your ſelf? No certainly. Nor will God.</p>
                     <p>A fifth Argument is; <hi>This hath been a time, wherein God hath drawn out the Graces of his People;</hi> which perhaps had they been ſuppreſt and not diſcovered, wee had been in no hazard.</p>
                     <p>And do you think that God will draw out the graces of his People, for the deſtruction of his people? Indeed nothing is more ordinary, than to draw out the ſins and corruptions of wicked men, for their own ruine, to bee Cart-ropes to binde themſelves. But wee never heard God did draw out the graces of his people for their ruine. Wee read, hee hath hardened wicked men to deſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but never made the heart tender, ſenſible to deſtruction. Men have periſhed by their fear, deſerting the cauſe of God: but never any who periſhed by their courage and ſtanding to it.</p>
                     <p>Did <hi>Eſther</hi> loſe any thing by her Obedience? did <hi>Daniel?</hi> did the <hi>three Children?</hi> It brought them into the fire, but preſerved them in the fire: nothing was conſumed but their bands: not one hair was ſinged. Though God do draw out the ſins of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, to their deſtruction, as <hi>Pharaoh, Haman, &amp;c.</hi> yet hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver draws out the graces of his People to their deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>I ſay no more but this. <hi>If God ſhould not preſerve us; if hee ſhould not do a wonder for us at this time, it is an untracted peece of Providence:</hi> wee have not a preſident of the like, ſince God had a Church: Hee doth with us ſo, as hee never did with any of his people ſince the beginning of the World.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 <hi>The Perſons againſt whom they ſet themſelves.</hi> And that is, againſt his Church, his People, his Saints, his Mourners, his Sighers, his Prayers, his Members, his Treaſures, his Jewels: Such as are as dear to him as the apple of his eye: ſuch as hee hath ſaid, <hi>hee will give men for, and people for their life.</hi> — Yea, and therefore are they enemies to theſe, becauſe they are friends to God; becauſe they run not out with them in the ſame exceſs of Riot, as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Look upon the perſons who are againſt us.</hi> They are ſuch as are declared to bee Papiſts, Atheiſts, ſcorners and contemners of God and his waies: ſuch as are proud, prophane, cruel, and bloody-minded-men: haters of God, blaſphemers of his Name, by new and hel-born oathes; ſuch as have made themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the ſtroak of Juſtice.

                     <p>Thus doth the wickedneſs of the enemy ſpeak deliverance to the Church of God: when the Devil drives his ſervants ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, it is a ſign they will quickly bee at their journies end. VVhen Satans rage is violent, it is not long; <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Woe bee to the Inhabitants of the Earth</hi> (that is, to the wicked, and the ungodly.) <hi>But rejoyce yee Heavens:</hi> (that is, <hi>yee Saints and People of God</hi>) why? <hi>For the Devil is come down, having great wrath.</hi> But can this bee a matter of rejoycing? Yea ſaith the Text, <hi>Becauſe hee hath but a ſhort time.</hi> VVhen the Devil comes down with great wrath, it prognoſticates his time is not long. VVhen men are grown ſo helliſh in their malice, their oathes and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:97371:226"/> that they are become an <hi>abhorring and abomination to men: Then will God certainly eaſe himſelf, and unburden a Nation of them.</hi> You have ſomething to this, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8, 9. when their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks there, was abhorred of all men, <hi>Then (ſaith hee) they ſhall proceed no further.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But you will tell mee, that this will not bee enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade with us, that God will do a wonder for us: For wee ſometimes read, that God hath given up the godly into the hands of wicked men, to bee puniſhed: as you read ordinarily in Scripture. And</hi> Habakkuk <hi>complains of the like,</hi> Hab. 1.17. Thou art of purer eyes, than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity? Wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue, when the wicked devoureth the man, that is more righteous than himſelf?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true. God hath ſometimes given up a people to others, who have been greater ſinners than themſelves. Hee hath given up one wicked Nation, to another that was more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than they. But wee do not read that God hath given up the good of one to the evil and wicked of the ſame Nation. But then</p>
                     <p n="2">2. VVhen God hath done this; it hath been, when hee was highly diſpleaſed with his people, after hee hath ſent Prophets to warn them, to humble and reform them; and yet they would continue obſtinate in their evil wayes, and would not bee reformed: as hee tells us at large, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 VVhen God hath done this; it hath been, when his own people have been ſo involved, and inwrapped with them, that there was no ſeparating between them. And thus oftentimes the Saints may bee involved in the ſame general calamities with the bad, becauſe of that politick union and conjunction that is between the Members of a ſtate and Common-wealth. So in a Common-wealth univerſally ſinful, a few righteous men may as parts of that ſinful ſociety, bee juſtly ſubject to thoſe tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evils, which the ſins of that ſociety have contracted upon them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 VVhen God hath done this, it hath been, when his own people have had communion with the ſins of them, with whom they live. VVhen there is a communion with the evill of ſin, wee muſt look for a communion with the evil of puniſhment. Oneneſs of ſin brings Oneneſs of ſufferings. But none of theſe are our caſe. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1 VVee are not to bee delivered up to another Nation; but to thoſe, who are Vipers in our own: and the good to the bad.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Though wee were involved together; yet they have ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves from us; which if it had not been done, wee might ſuſpect, that ſuch <hi>Jona's</hi> would raiſe ſtorms.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, the way for wicked men to bee preſerved, is, to body
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:97371:226"/> themſelves with the Saints, is to abide by them; whiles the VVheat and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ares grew together, the Tares were preſerved. The Tares had not been preſerved, if they had not been in the field with the Wheat: But being there, God would not pluck up the Tares, leſt the Wheat alſo ſhould bee deſtroyed. But when the Wheat is gathered in; or if the Tares ſhall ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Wheat, bundle themſelves together againſt the Saints: it is the ready way to their own deſtruction, that is the way to have no mercy; when God may deal with them ſingle, and there bee none with them to bear off the blow.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Gods People have not communion with them in their ſins.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They do not approve of them in their Judgements.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They do not conſent to them in their wills.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They do not act them in their lives.</hi> This is to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They are grieved with them;</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> was, <hi>his ſoul was grieved with the ſins of Sodom.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They are grieved for them;</hi> not only with them, but for them. They are matter of their mourning. Thus <hi>David ſhed rivers of tears, becauſe the wicked kept not Gods law, Ezek.</hi> 9.4. A mark was to bee ſet on the foreheads of them, who were <hi>Sighers and mourners for the ſins of</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They are not only grieved with, and grieved for; but they Pray down, Preach down, mourn down, live down;</hi> the ſins of this ſinful Common-wealth; which may bee an argument to us, that God will preſerve us from that overflowing ſcourge, that devouring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, which he may bring upon wicked men.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed God hath done much for his People in all ages of the World; you may ſee his Wonders upon record. But all theſe are nothing in compariſon of thoſe, which hee hath ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do for them hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The World is the ſtage, on which God will act all his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and it cannot bee long before this frame bee diſſolved, and this ſtage bee taken down. If Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time were the laſt hour, ſurely ours are the laſt minute.</p>
                     <p>But yet God will not take down the ſtage, till all hath been acted, which hee hath ingaged himſelf to do for his Church.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſay, <hi>God hath ingaged himſelf to deſtroy that man of ſinne: to make his Church glorious.</hi>

                     <p>Read at your leaſure; how much God hath promiſed to do for his Church, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. throughout, <hi>Glorious Promiſes,</hi> which though they had a gradual accompliſhment in the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel, yet not ſo fully as the Words there hold out, which yet muſt bee made good, and therefore it is yet to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the Church hath been buried up under reproach, ſcorn, and perſecution: hitherto ſufferings, Priſons, Fires, ſtakes, they have been the Portion of the Church.</p>
                     <p>As yet, (though we have had our <hi>Lucida intervalla, our Reſpites, and Breathings) The Church of God</hi> hath been, like <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, toſſing, and fluctuating upon the Billows, and devouring waves of troubles and Perſecutions. And the <hi>Saints under the Altar, the blood of the ſlain,</hi> crys, <hi>How long Lord, holy and true!</hi> though they ſay, <hi>How long,</hi> yet they ſay, <hi>Holy and true:</hi> They give God the glory of his truth and faithfulneſſe. Though hee defer the accompliſhment, of what he hath promiſed, yet hee is true of his promiſe.</p>
                     <p>And hath God ingaged himſelf to make his <hi>Churches glorious,</hi> and that before the end of all things? And is the day ſo neer to an End? And is <hi>God faithfull,</hi> is <hi>hee true of his Promiſe?</hi> why this may ſomething perſwade with us, that notwithſtanding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent oppoſitions, and troubles, <hi>God is now comming in with mercy and deliverance to his Church and People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And God hath not left us without home-hopes, that the work is begun — <hi>That mighty Spirit of Prayer,</hi> which God hath poured out upon his People; <hi>That increaſe of light and knowledge, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the man of ſinne,</hi> in thoſe <hi>two Limbs,</hi> whereon hee hath ſtood ſo ſtrongly: <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain: that numerous increaſe of converts, within theſe few years:</hi> All which are fore-running ſigns of the <hi>Riſing Condition of the Church.</hi> God doth not uſe to beget <hi>Children to the Murderers;</hi> nor <hi>to increaſe the number of his People,</hi> to fatten the ſword of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, when God hath intended to bring judgements upon a People, <hi>Hee hath taken his People away: hee hath leſſened the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> as hee tells us <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. <hi>Hee takes them away from the evil to come:</hi> but hee <hi>never increaſeth them againſt judgements.</hi> As the leſſening preſageth judgement: ſo, when he increaſeth them, it is a preſage of mercy.</p>
                     <p>Every one, that is <hi>now brought in,</hi> every <hi>Convert</hi> we have, is a <hi>Pledge to this Nation,</hi> that God will nor <hi>deſtroy this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Nay, it is an evidence, <hi>that God will do great things for us.</hi>

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 7.17. It is ſaid, <hi>When the time of Promiſe drew nigh, the people grew and multiplyed in Egypt.</hi> Their growing was a ſign of their riſing: their increaſe diſcovered the promiſed mercy was not far off.</p>

                     <p>And theſe are the hopeful ſigns, that the <hi>day of the Churches redemption draws nigh, and is even at the doors.</hi> As Chriſt ſaid of the fig-tree, <hi>when you ſee the Fig-tree bud, and put forth her leaves; know that Summer is nigh;</hi> So when you ſee theſe things, you may know, <hi>that the Churches Redemption is at hand.</hi> God is riſen upon his throne, and will not ſit down (if our ſins do not make him repent) till hee have made his Church glorious in the earth.</p>
                     <p>And now having told you my thoughts, and that which <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades with me to hope, that God will do a wonder for us,</hi> yet I muſt tell you again (that you may not bee diſcouraged with the <hi>ſad appearance of things</hi>) that wee may ſuffer many throws, many pangs, much oppoſition, and perhaps ſome <hi>bloud,</hi> before theſe things. God will ſave us <hi>From trouble, by trouble:</hi> He will bring us through a Sea, and through the wilderneſſe unto <hi>Canaan.</hi> Yet I will ſay as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> did, Numb. 14.8. <hi>If the Lord hath any delight in us, hee will bring us into this Land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God ſeldome doth great things, without great commotions. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were not delivered out of Priſon, but by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. Though it bee grievous to ſee, yet it is that wee fear. And wee muſt not forſake a good cauſe, becauſe of oppoſition. This were <hi>to leap, out of the ſhip, becauſe the winds blow: to bee impatient of the Ark, becauſe the billows riſe: to ſeek our ſafety in the midſt of Danger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This aſſure your ſelves: Though Earth and hell ſhould fight againſt you: your ſafety lyes on Gods ſide, in Gods cauſe: and there is no ſafety elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things I ſuggeſt to you, by way of <hi>Cautional adviſe:</hi> that when you ſee theſe things, you may not be troubled. As Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Theſe things I tell you before, that when they do come to paſſe, your hearts may not bee troubled:</hi> So theſe things I tell you before, that, though <hi>God will deliver us from trouble, yet it will bee by trouble:</hi> though hee ſave us, yet it ſhall bee by fire: that, when you ſee theſe things you may not bee troubled, when you ſee ſtorms to fall, oppoſitions and troubles to ariſe, you may not bee <hi>moved from your own ſtedfaſtneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I tell you, this is neceſſary advice, a ſeaſonable admonition to you: leſt the oppoſitions and ſeeming contrarieties of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings ſhould weaken your faith, and move you from your own ſtedfaſtneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The beſt of us are too apt <hi>to live by ſenſe, and not by faith; by works, and not by the Word; by Gods outward appearances, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Providence, and not by Promiſes.</hi> And therefore out Faith, doth wane, or increaſe according as God doth let out, or reſtrain himſelf in the ways of his Providence, when God doth let out himſelf to ſuccour and releeve his Church; when wee ſee deliverance in the Promiſe, and deliverance in his outward proceedings too; then wee can believe: but, if God do any
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:97371:228"/> way reſtrain himſelf, or his outward Proceedings do ſeem to walk contrary to his own Promiſes: Though perhaps that bee the next way for the performance of his Promiſes. As you ſee it was with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the Promiſe ſpake one thing; and Gods outward proceedings ſeemed to ſpeak ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe wee are ready to give up all, and thus did <hi>David:</hi> I ſhall one time or other periſh by the hand of <hi>Saul;</hi> and therefore wee ſhould learn this leſſon in ſome kinde, to ſhut our eyes to the works of God, and look upon the Word of God: Not only to look upon the outward proceedings of Providence: but upon the ſtability and truth of the promiſe: and ſee the Word ſay Yea, when the Works ſeem to ſay Nay: and conclude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Promiſe ſaith, it ſhall bee; though all ſecondary means, whereby the Promiſe ſhould bee performed, ſay, <hi>It ſhall not bee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>VVee read that <hi>Uliſses;</hi> when hee was to paſs the Coaſt of the <hi>Syrens,</hi> hee cauſed his men to ſtop their ears, that they might not bee inchanted by their muſick, to deſtroy themſelves: But for himſelf, hee would only bee bound to the Maſt, that though hee ſhould hear, yet their muſick might not bee ſo ſtrong as to allure him to deſtroy himſelf, and leap into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome of Gods people who are weak in Faith: And when they ſee Gods outward proceedings of Providence ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly contrary to his Promiſes; they are apt to bee charmed from their own ſtedfaſtneſs. Now as for theſe, it were good for them to ſtop their ears, and to ſhut their eyes to the works, and look altogether upon the VVord of God: But there are ſome that are ſtronger, and therefore may look upon the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of God: But withall let them binde themſelves faſt to the Maſt, the VVord of God; leſt, when they ſee the ſeeming contrariety of his proceedings to the Promiſe, they bee charmed from their own ſtedfaſtneſs, to the wounding of their own ſouls.</p>
                     <p>God hath promiſed, <hi>that Antichriſt ſhall fall:</hi> Hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>to make his Church glorious.</hi> And though in outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings hee ſhould ſeem to uphold the one, and evil intreat the other; yet let not this weaken our Faith, in beleeving the truth of what God hath promiſed.</p>
                     <p>If you put a ſtreight ſtick into the water, yet ſenſe will render it to bee crooked; it will appear ſo to the eye: but reaſon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects it, and tells you, though it appear to bee ſo, yet it is not ſo; you put it in ſtreight, and ſo it is.</p>
                     <p>Doth reaſon prevail againſt ſenſe? and why ſhould not Faith prevail againſt Reaſon? when to outward appearance, God ſeems to bee againſt us, why ſhould not wee by Faith conclude, that God is for us? even for us, when hee ſeems to bee againſt us?</p>
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:97371:228"/>
                     <p>The outward face of things may bee ſuch as may poſſeſſe the Church with fear, when God hath a purpoſe to do great things for his Church. So you read in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.21. <hi>Fear not, O Land; bee glad, and rejoyce; for the Lord will do great things for you.</hi> It was a time of Joy, in reſpect of Gods purpoſe; and yet a time of fear, in reſpect of their preſent apprehenſions. God had a purpoſe to do great things for them, and yet the face and outward appearance of things were ſuch, as did at that time poſſeſſe the Church with fear. It was ſo; but it ſhould not have been ſo.</p>
                     <p>You ſee what Chriſt ſaith, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.25. <hi>There ſhall bee ſigns in the Sun, in the Moon, in the Stars; and upon the earth diſtreſſe of Nations; the Sea and Waters roaring, mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after the things that ſhall come upon the Earth, for the Powers of Heaven ſhall bee ſhaken.</hi> Could there bee a ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der appearance? And yet ſaith <hi>Chriſt, when theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</hi>

                     <p>Here you ſee Chriſt doth turn the ſaddeſt and ſoreſt perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that ever the world ſhall ſee, into a Doctrin of Comfort to his Church; becauſe all theſe things were but a preparatory to the redemption of the Church.</p>
                     <p>One would think this to bee a ſtrange conſequent deduced from ſuch an Antecedent: A Conſequent ſo comfortable, from an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent ſo terrible: that ſo terrible a Doctrin ſhould afford us an uſe of <hi>Conſolation.</hi> Yet ſo it is. Bee the premiſes what they will, the concluſion is good. Bee his Providences what they will, his Promiſe is good; and thoſe promiſes ſhall turn all thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences to good.</p>
                     <p>And this is the admonition I give you, that whatever oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whatever troubles, whatever evils wee meet withall in the way of deliverance; Bee not troubled, let not your hearts bee diſcouraged: for this is the way whereby God will do you good; making all your evil and trouble ſubſervient to good.</p>

                     <p>It is our ſin only, which hinders the current of Mercy, that ſtops the ſtream of Mercy: our unbeleef, our neglect of duty, our unthankfulneſs, our pride, &amp;c.

                        <note place="margin">9 Information.</note>9. Information. This may inform us, what is the reaſon <hi>that God ſuffers wicked men to conceive, and to hatch miſchief againſt the Church:</hi> Nay, <hi>and to bring up their deſignes to ripeneſs, that they are ready for execution: why God doth not disturb them all their way.</hi> Here is the Reaſon. <hi>Becauſe hee can do wonders.</hi> Though hee let them go on, yet they can never get the advantage of God, nor can they make it paſt Gods help. It is but <hi>ſhewing a wonder at laſt, and all is daſht.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men, when they ſee an adverſary, whom they can eaſily Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when they pleaſe, they will let them go on, counſel, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, lay their heads and power together, and ſeem to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them. They know, the further they let them go, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and compleater will bee their overthrow at laſt.</p>
                     <p>So doth God here. Hee ſuffers wicked men to go on, but is, becauſe hee knoweth hee can overtake them, though they think they have got the ſtart, before they come to the goal, or get the prize.</p>
                     <p>When men ſee, there would bee ſome hazard at laſt, when they had brought their deſign to ripeneſs, or did fear, that the adverſary would bee too ſtrong for them: then they will labour to hinder the beginnings and gatherings; they will indeavour to cruſh the birth of their counſels, or they will ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their power, as ſoon as they can. And this is the wiſeſt way among men.</p>
                     <p>But now God, hee can let them go on; hee can let them bring their deſignes to ripeneſſe; they can never ſwell ſo big, as to bee too great for his power to conquer them; can never make their deſign ſo ſtrong, as to <hi>non-plus</hi> his wiſdome, and skill to help.</p>
                     <p>And therefore hee will let them go on, becauſe hee can daſh them in their Man-hood, as well as in their infancy, in their
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:97371:232"/> ſtrength, as well as in their weakneſſe. It is but ſhewing a wonder, and all is done.</p>
                     <p>And this was the Reaſon why God ſuffered the five Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> to lay all their ſtrength together, that they might bee able to do that joyntly, which they were never able to do ſingly. Yet it is ſaid, — <hi>The Lord hardened their hearts to joyn together, to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Iſrael. Though they thought by this means to overthrow <hi>Iſrael:</hi> yet Gods end was to make the quicker diſpatch, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler overthrow of them.</p>
                     <p>And therefore hee let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> alſo to go on; did not ſtop him in his preparations, nor hinder him in his ſetting forth, but let him follow them to the utmoſt. God knew hee could have him at the laſt; hee could ſhew a wonder, and break all in peeces.</p>
                     <p>The like of <hi>Haman.</hi> God could, if hee would, have daſht his bloody counſel in the beginning; hee could have ſet the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. But hee lets him go on, and bring his deſign to ripeneſſe; and then declares a wonder, and ruines him and his counſel too.</p>
                     <p>And this is the reaſon why God ſuffers wicked men to go on, gather themſelves together, bring their deſigns to the utmoſt: Becauſe hee can break them in the end, as well as in the beginning. It is but doing a wonder at laſt, which is familiar with God; and all is broken in peeces. And therefore <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non est judicandum de operibus dei ante quartum actum.</hi>

                     <p>Gods people are dear to God; they are all the riches hee hath in the World: Hee calls them ſo: <hi>His Inheritance, his Portion, his Jewels, his Treaſure.</hi> Hee hath a great deal of lumber in the world beſides: but theſe are his Jewels only; and it coſt him dear to make them Jewels. It was no leſſer than the price of his own blood. As the Apoſtle ſaith — <hi>You were not redeemed with ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19.

                     <p>And do you think then, that God will not preſerve his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? yes certainly, and will not ſtand to do wonders to preſerve them.

                     <p>God hath promiſed, <hi>That hee will never leave us, nor forſake us:</hi> Hee hath ſaid — <hi>Hee will bee with us,</hi> as hee was with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in Priſon. And that not onely as a Spectator but as an Actor: not as one to look on, and take notice onely: but as one to relieve and help us. His power ſhall bee with us, his Wiſdome with us, &amp;c.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>VVee ſhould not know, what God can do, if it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, what man cannot do; we ſhould not know the power of God, if we did not ſee the weakneſſe of man.</p>
                     <p>It was <hi>Bernards</hi> rapture upon the meditation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin.— <hi>Foelix culpa! quae talem meruit redemptorem! Happy fault! which occaſioned us ſuch a Redeemer!</hi> I may better ſay. <hi>Happy neceſſity! which occaſioned the reliefs, of ſuch a God, which ingageth God to help us, and relieve us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Were it not for the greatneſſe of our miſery, wee ſhould not have experiences of Gods mercy. And how many would ſay, I would not loſe the Experiences of Gods goodneſſe, in ſuch a ſad condition I was in, for a thouſand worlds? I would rather go through a thouſand ſuch ſad conditions, than want one of thoſe experiences of his mercy in it.</p>
                     <p>At theſe times you ſhall have Experience of Gods Power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, mercy, faithfulneſs, more than all your life. All which are drawn out to help in need.</p>
                     <p>As I never knew confident ſtrength to proſper, ſo I never read
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:97371:235"/> of truſting weakneſſe to miſcarry. If you peruſe the word, you ſhall often read, that Gods people have miſcarryed in the ſtrength of means, but never read, they miſcarried in weakneſſe. And the Reaſon is, becauſe they truſted God in the one, and were ſelf-confident in the other.</p>
                     <p>This is our ſpirit, when means are weak and wanting, then wee flye to God; but when means are ſtrong to bring purpoſes to paſſe, wee are apt to reſt upon them.</p>
                     <p>You ſee it was ſo with <hi>Aſa:</hi> Once hee was weak, and then hee truſted: another time hee was ſtrong, and then hee was ſelf confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And the iſſue in the one, was, — <hi>hee proſpered;</hi> in the other — <hi>hee miſcarried.</hi> Weak means were ſucceſsful, becauſe the ſtrong God was in them; his Faith brought God into them: and ſtrong means were unfruitful, becauſe hee made God of them, hee truſted in them.</p>
                     <p>As God thinks himſelf neglected, when wee will not truſt in him, in the preſence of means: ſo hee thinks his power diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, when wee will not truſt in him, in the abſence of means. Not to truſt in God in ſtrength of means, is to neglect God. Not to truſt in him in weakneſſe of means, is to limit God.</p>
                     <p>God loves then to appear, when none elſe will, when none elſe can. It was the Argument which <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.11. — <hi>Bee not far from mee, for trouble is near; for there is none to help.</hi> This was that whereby hee would ingage God to help: becauſe there was <hi>none elſe to help him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As it was ſaid of the Redemption of the Church from ſin: ſo it may bee ſaid of her deliverance from trouble. — <hi>When hee looks about, and ſees no man, then his right hand ſhall bring ſalvation.</hi> Hee will <hi>do a wonder</hi> to ſave you.</p>
                     <p>Though there bee <hi>Mountains of Oppoſitions</hi> in the way, yet hee can incounter with them; and there are four wayes God deals with <hi>Mountains,</hi> with <hi>ſtrong Oppoſitions.</hi>

Can hee provide fleſh for his people?</hi> One would think this a ſenſeleſſe reaſoning. But Unbeleef is a ſenſeleſſe ſin. One would think that they did ſufficiently anſwer themſelves. That what went before, had been anſwer ſufficient to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after. The ſame power was required for the doing of the one, that was for the other; and when they had ſeen the power of God to work the greater, 'twas ſtrange they ſhould doubt of the leſſe, but here is the baſeneſſe of our ſpirit; Though God have given us never ſo many experiences: yet wee are ſtill to ſeek in every new act of dependence on him. And without further grace wee cannot do it.</p>
                     <p>Wee think, when wee are in ſtraits and difficulties, if God would but help us through this ſtrait, if hee would but relieve us in this difficulty; wee ſhould never diſtruſt God, whilſt vvee lived; wee ſhould depend on him in the ſaddeſt conditions, whiles wee have a being.</p>
                     <p>But theſe are but our preſent thoughts, and without future aſſiſtances and ſupplies, wee are as far to ſeek in another, as wee were in the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Well, My Brethren: God hath wrought many great things for us: every one of them ſhould bee a <hi>Life-mercy,</hi> a <hi>ſtanding-mercy,</hi> a <hi>mercy</hi> to bee ſet up <hi>to incourage us to depend on him for ever:</hi> Mercies, that wee ſhould live on in ſtraits, and feed upon in difficulties; mercies that ſhould bee for ſtore to feed upon for a long time.</p>
                     <p>You have an expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.14. — <hi>Thou brakest the head of the Leviathan in peeces, and gaveſt him to bee meat to thy people in the Wilderneſs.</hi> — By <hi>Leviathan</hi> is meant <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and God gave him to bee meat to his people in the wilderneſſe. That is, Hee wrought that deliverance for them, before they entred into the wilderneſſe, that this might bee meat for them to feed upon, and ſtrengthen their Faith in dependence upon God in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where they were put to it, by ſo many difficulties. This mercy was to bee a ſtanding-diſh, not for a meal only, but for ſtore: meat laid in to feed on, to ſtrengthen their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>Faith is called Feeding, <hi>John</hi> 6. And the experience of Gods goodneſſe is <hi>Pabulum Fidei:</hi> the meat of Faith. That mercy is never well digeſted, that is not fed upon. Hee that doth not feed upon a mercy, gets no nouriſhment by a mercy, no good. You take the Name of God in vain (that is, his works, his experiences, which are part of his Name) you take them in vain: All this is
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:97371:237"/> but food caſt away upon you, if thereby you are not ſtrengthned for the <hi>Fuller dependence</hi> upon God.</p>
                     <p>And now my brethren, wee have had many <hi>Glorious experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods goodneſs to us:</hi> and all theſe are meat to feed upon. You are now in new ſtraits and difficulties: bring out your ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-diſhes, the former mercyes and experiences to feed upon; to refreſh your <hi>Faith,</hi> to inable you to depend upon God afreſh.</p>
                     <p>Hee that is not a good Treaſurer, a good Storer of mercys, hee is never out of ſtraits; hee is ſtill to ſeek in every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and gone in every new ſtrait: whereas hee who laies up Experiences, and can make uſe of them, feed upon them; hee ſhall be inabled thereby to depend upon God in any ſtrait and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee <hi>David — God delivered me out of the Paw of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and out of the paw of the Bear: and hee will deliver mee out of the hand of this Philiſtim.

But thoſe thoughts and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, were, for the preſent darkened, and over-ſhadowed with Paſſion; and therefore hee could not truſt God then.</p>

                     <p>So, did Gods people ſee God at all times, as they do at ſome times, they would then be able to depend on God, and truſt in him, in any caſes though never ſo difficult: but if they loſe the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and conceptions of God; and ſuffer Paſſion and fear, to raiſe up a cloud to overſhadow and darken their underſtandings; they ſhall never bee able to beleeve and depend upon God in any difficulty: and therefore firſt hold up the Notions of God, of his power, wiſdom, mercy, and the like.</p>

                     <p>And indeed the want of the remembrance of former mercies doth cauſe us to diſtruſt, and hinders us in our dependence on God for preſent and future ſtraits: whereas on the contrary; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the remembrance of former, will inable us to hold out in preſent and future diſtreſſes.</p>
                     <p>You cannot think his arm is ſhortned: you cannot think God cannot: nor can you think God will not: that he hath helped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and will help no more: for <hi>mercy is tyed to the Church by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
